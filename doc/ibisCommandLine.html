IBIS <A href="#ibis">[1]</A> is an Implementation of Bitmap Indexing
System named <A href="https://sdm.lbl.gov/fastbit">FastBit</A>.
This document explains the command line tool named <code>ibis</code>,
which is a shorthand for <emph>Interactive Bitmap Index Search</emph>.
Under FastBit, user data is organized into containers called tables and
each table consists of an arbitrary number of rows and columns.  In
SQL algebra, the rows and columns are also called tuples and attributes.
In this document, we will use the terms attribute and column
interchangeably.</p>
<p>
A table is physically organized into one or more data partitions, so
that one column from a partition can comfortably fit in computer memory.
Each data partition is stored in a directory on file systems and the
command line tool <code>ibis</code> works with data directories.

<ul>
<li><A href="#example">An example</A></li>
<li><A href="#options">List of options</A></li>
<li><A href="#select">Query statement syntax</A></li>
<li><A href="#output">Sample output</A></li>
</ul>

<h2><A name="example">An example</A></h2>

Take the dataset on <code>falkland.jgi-psf.org</code> as an example, the
following command prints all the machine names (<code>mchn</code>) and the
temperature values (<code>tmpr</code>) where the temperature is not one of
the nominal values (55 for MegaBace and 60 for ABI).

<pre>
/home/kwu/bin/ibis -c /home/kwu/bin/ibis.rc -v -q "select mchn, tmpr where ! (tmpr == 55 || tmpr == 60)"
</pre>

On the particular machine, the most current version of the ibis
executable is <code>/home/kwu/bin/ibis</code>.  The file name following
option <code>-c</code> is the configuration file name.  Alternatively, one
may directly specify the data directory on command line use '-d
data-directory-path'.  The particular file
contains the current version of JGI trace data header information.  The
attribute names <A href="#trac">[2]</A> are available in the data directories
<code>/psf/QC/Projects/IBIS/Datasets</code>.

<p>
The main option is <code>-q</code> which is followed by a query string.  The
basic syntax follows that of SQL, however, only the basic features of
the SQL's select statement is implemented.  Here we will first mention a
few limitations that might cause non-descriptive failures of ibis.

<ul>

<li> If two instance's of ibis are run at the same to create indexes,
they may overwrite each other's output and produce something that is
totally unusable.

<li> The computation of the functions SUM and AVG are performed using in
the arithmetic supported on the type of the selected variable.  For
example, if variable a is an integer, the function SUM(a) will be
computed using integer arithmetic.  This may lead to overflow in certain
cases.  The same overflow problem affects both SUM and AVG.

<li> No multiple-table operations are supported.  If multiple tables are
specified, it will simply apply the same condition on all the tables.
This is mostly used to split a large dataset into more manageable
chunks.

</ul>

<p>
The option <code>-v</code> tells ibis to be verbose.  If this option is not
supplied, only the number of hits and the result of the select clause
are printed.  The result of the select clause may be appended to a file
instead of printed to standard output.  To use this option, specify
'-output name'.


<h2><A name="options">List of options</A></h2>

Here is the full list of options.  Additional information about command
line options, including those not mentioned here, please see the <A
 HREF="https://sdm.lbl.gov/fastbit/doc/html/ibis_8cpp.html">inline
documentation of ibis.cpp</A>.

<ul>

<li><code>-a[ppend] data_dir [[to] output_directory or partition_name]</code>
<br>Take the data in the named directory and append it to the data
parition with the specified name or a directory with the specified path.
In the current implementation, the second argument
following <code>-a</code> is checked to see it is a directory first.
If it is a directory name, then it is used as a directory name,
otherwise, the second argument is used to find a data partition with
the same name (with a case-insensitive search).</p><p>
<em>Note</em>: If no second argument is provided, ibis attempts to use
the meta tags contained in the table to generate a name.  If no meta
tags are found, it will generate a random name.
<p>
More information about loading data can be found in <A
href="dataLoading.html">dataLoading.html</a>.


<li><A name="build"></A>
<code>-b[uild-index] [num-threads|indexing-option|name-option-pair]</code>
<br>Instruct FastBit to build indexes of all datasets known.  Usually FastBit
builds indexes as needed, therefore there is no need to explicitly build
indexes.
<p>
The option <code>-b</code> may be followed by one of three types of
arguments, an integer to indicate the number of simultaneous
threads to use while building the indexes, a bare indexing option to indicate
the type of indexes to build for all columns, or a name-option pair to
  indicate indexing option for a subset of columns.  An
  indexing option is a string for the following form,
"<code>&lt;binning nbins=1000/&gt; &lt;encoding range ncomp=2/&gt;</code>".
Additional ifnormation about the indexing option is available at <A
HREF="indexSpec.html">indexSpec.html</A>.
</p>
<p>
  A name-option pair starts with a column name or a name pattern,
  followed by the semicolon ':' and an indexing option string.  There is
  no need to put spaces around the semicolon, in fact, ibis.cpp prefers
  to have no spaces or any other separator around the semicolon.
The name pattern may use SQL wild cards or c-shell wild cards.  The
following example name-option pair
  "c*:<code>&lt;binning precision=2/&gt;</code>" will index all
columns whose names starting with the letter "c" with the indexing option
"<code>&lt;binning precision=2/&gt;</code>".
</p>
<p>Multiple -b options may appear on the command line.  The name-option
pairs are used in the order as they appear on the command line.  Only
the last bare indexing option is used if any is specified.  The integer
values following -b are added together.  An option -b appearing by
itself is treated the same as '-b 1', therefore multple bare -b options will
inrease the number of threads used to build indexes.
For example, the following set of -b options,
<pre>
-b "a%:&lt;binning none/&gt;" -b ".b*:&lt;encoding interval-equality/&gt;" -b -b -b "bit-slice"
</pre>
will build indexes with two threads.  All columns with 'a' as the first
letter of their name will be index without binning (i.e., "&lt;binning
none/&gt;").  Columns whose name does not match the first pattern will
be compared to the second pattern, all those with names containing b as
the second letter will be indexed with the option "&lt;encoding
interval-equality/&gt;".  The columns whose names do not match either
one of the two patterns will be indexed with the option "bit-slice".
</p>
<p>
Since building indexes is an expensive operation, FastBit by default
only builds new index for a column if no index currently exists.  To
force FastBit to remove existing indexes and rebuild them from
scratch, specify option <code>-z</code> in addition.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note</em>: The numbre of threads to use depends heavily on the
amount of memory available.  Indexes are built one column of a data
partition at a time.  Each thread works one a column of a partition at
any given time, and the index for the column is built completely
in-memory before written to disk.  If your data partitions are large,
then each threads will require a lot of memory to complete it work.  The
default number of threads to use for index building is one (1).
</p>

<li><code>-c[onf] conf_file</code>

<br>Specify a configuration file.  If no configuration file is
specified, it will look for a file named "ibis.rc" in the current
working directory.  If that file does not exist, it will also look at
the environment variable named IBISRC.  If the environment variable is
defined, its value is taken to be the rc file.  One of the most
noticeable entries defined in the rc file is the "DataDir1" and
"DataDir2" entries.  They define the data directories used by IBIS.  On
UNIX systems, <code>ibis</code> will also recursively traverse the
directories to find directory pairs with the same name and the matching
<code>-part.txt</code> files.  Each such pair defined a partition.  If
different data partitions have the same name, only the last one will be
kept.
<p>
Using a pair of directories for a data partition was intended to improve
reliability and reduce the transition time when appending data.  In most
cases, it is fine to use only one directory for each data partition, in
which case, one simply do not specify "DataDir2".  More information
about the configuration file is available in <A
HREF="dataLoading.html">dataLoading.html</A>.


<li><A name="data"></A><code>-d[atadir] data_dir [backup_dir]</code>

<br>As an alternative to specify the data directories in a configuration
file, one may specified them directly on the command line.  The effect
of "data_dir" and "backup_dir" are the same as "DataDir1" and "DataDir2"
in the RC file.

<li><code>-e[stimation-only]</code>
<br>Output a range for the number of hits rather than the exact number
of hits.  Note, the estimation is applicable to queries contain
only simple range conditions without negation.  Otherwise, the
estimation may return 0 as both the upper and lower bound of the number
of hits.

<li><code>-h[elp]</code>
<Br>Print a short usage statement.

<li><code>-i[nteractive]]</code> <br>Tell ibis to enter an interactive
mode after finishing processing the command line arguments.  In the
interactive mode, the user may directly use the SELECT statement
described below with the option <code>-q</code> or use a query file
containing the select statements followed by ';' in a query file using
the option <code>-f</code>.  There are also a small number of other
commands that can be used in the interactive mode.  Type "help" in the
interactive mode to see a list.

<li><code>-l[logfile] logfilename</code>
<br>Redirect all messages printed out by <code>ibis</code> to the named
file.  The file is opened in append mode, therefore the existing content
is preserved.  The only message that may still be printed to standard
output is something indicating the name of the message file.

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: this file contains the error messages and other
information.  If option <code>-o</code> is also specified, the file
specified in that option will contain the results of select statements.
</p>

<li><code>-n[o-estimation]</code>
<br>Forces <code>ibis</code> to evaluate the number of hits without
first performing an estimation.

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: options <code>-no-estimation</code> and
<code>-estimation-only</code> are mutually exclusive, the one that
appears later will overwrite the one that appears early on the same
command line.
</p>

<li><code>-o[utput-[with-header|as-binary]] name</code>

<br>Tell <code>ibis</code> to append the result of select statements to
the named file/directory.  The program <code>ibis</code> scans for the
letter b to determine whether or not to output results in binary first.
When outputting in binary format, the name is taken to the directory to
contain the output.  This binary format is usable by FastBit.  If the
letter b is not found, <code>ibis</code> will write the selected data in
ASCII format.  If it finds the letter h in this option, it will also
write a header before writing the ASCII data.

<p> <em>NOTE</em>: the results from multiple select clauses on the same
command line will be written to the same output file or directory.  When
outputting in the binary format (-output-as-binary), the given name is
taken to be a directory name, in all other cases, the given name is
taken to be the output file name.  When output binary data, the new
results is always appended; when writing in ASCII format, the existing
file content will be erased regardless of whether the query processing
is successful or not.  In cases of error, the output file would be
empty.

<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: When outputting ASCII data with header, the results from each
select clause will have its own header since different select clause
might have different columns.
<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: When outputting binary data, the resulting directory will
contain a superset of all columns.  A new set of data is always assumed
to be a new set of rows to the data table.  Any missing values, such as
those existing columns that do not appear in the new set or new columns
that do not appear in the old rows, will be assumed to be NULL values.
<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: this option controls the output of the results from
select statments only.  Other messages, such as errors, progress
information, and debug information, may be redirected with option
<code>-l</code>.
</p>

<li><code>-p[rint] [Parts|Columns|Distributions|column-name [:
conditions]]</code>
<br>Print information about the tables known to ibis program.

<li><A name="query"></A><code>-q[uery] [SELECT ...] [FROM ...] WHERE ...</code>
<br>On most systems the strings following <code>-q</code> must be quoted in
order for them to be perceived as one argument.

<li><code>-f query-file-name</code><br> A list of select statements can
be placed in a file, where each select statement is followed by a
semi-column ';' per SQL standard.  This option take the query file name
and read the queries into an internal list of queries.  It is possible
to execute the queries using multiple threads with the option
<code>-th</code>.

<li><code>-rid[-check] [filename]</code>

<br>This option will tells <code>ibis</code> to verify the RIDs can be
used in queries of their own.  If the optional file name is present, the
RIDs will also be written into the named file.

<li><code>-reorder data_dir[:colname1,colname2,...]</code>

<br>This option instructs <code>ibis</code> to reorder the data in the
specified directory.  An optional list of column name may be used to
specify which columns are to be used as sorting keys.  If no key is
specified, the integer valued columns will be used and the one with the
smallest range of values will be used first.

<br>Rules for distinguishing between -rid-check and -reorder:
<ul>
  <li>If the second letter is 'i' or 'I', then it is assume to be
  -rid-check,
  <li>otherwise it is assumed to -reorder if there is an argument
  following it,
  <li>if there is no argument follor '-r', the option is assumed to be
  -rid-check.
</ul>

<li><code>-s[quential-scan]</code>
<br>For ibis to check the answer produced from the index operations with
a sequence scan of the raw data.

<li><code>-t[=n]</code>
<br>Instructs ibis to perform predefined self tests.  If a positive
integer is provided, it takes the given number as the number of tests to
perform.

<li><code>-th=n</code>
<br>Instructs ibis to start <code>n</code> threads to answer queries.
Typically, the queries would be specified through the option <code>-f</code>.

<li><code>-v[=n]</code>
<br>Any integer can be specified as the verbose level.  Typically range
are 1 -- 20.  Use a negative number to mute <code>ibis</code>.

<li><code>-y [rowidlist|conditions]</code>
<br>This option tells IBIS to yank the specified rows from further query
processing.  It can take either a file with a list of row numbers or a
set of condititions in the same syntax as the where clauses.  The rows
with ids matching the row ids in the named file or matching the
specified conditions will be marked as "inactive" in future query
processing.

<br>This options can be reversed by <code>-k
[rowidlist|conditions]</code>.

<br>An additional option <code>-z</code> can be used together with
<code>-y</code> to tell IBIS to zap the inactive rows away.

</ul>

<h2><A name="select">Query statement syntax</A></h2>
<p>
The command line tool <code>ibis</code> supports a limited version of
the SQL select statement.  It recognizes four key words, SELECT, FROM
WHERE and ORDER BY.  The key words are not case-sensitive, neither are
the names of variables or functions described below.</p>

<p>
The key word SELECT must be followed by a list of attribute names or one
of the supported functions, separated by commas (,).
The attribute names must be from the available datasets.  If any name is
not in the available dataset, IBIS treats it same as no attribute
provided.  If no attribute is provided, the SELECT key must not be used.
In which case, only the number of hits would be printed.  The four
functions each take one argument that must be a column name of an
available dataset.  The variables not appearing in any functions are
implicitly passed to a SQL 'GROUP BY' clause and the functions are
defined on the groups defined by this implicit 'GROUP BY' clause.  For
example, the select clause 'SELECT mchn, avg(q20), min(snra)' will order
the selected records according to machine name (mchn), and for each
machine the average Q20 score and the minimum SNRA value will be
computed.
<B>NOTE</B> that the current version of ibis.cpp does not support
explicit a 'GROUP BY' clause.
</p>

<p>  The supported functions are:
<ul>
  <li> AVG: average
  <li> MAX: maximum
  <li> MIN: minimum
  <li> SUM: sum
  <li> COUNT: count the number of rows of the named variable.  The
  actual value of the name is ignored, it may be '*'.
  <li> COUNTDISTINCT: count the number of distinct value of the named variable.
  <li> VAR: variance
  <li> VARP: population variance
  <li> STDEV: standard deviation
  <li> STDEVP: population standard deviation
  <li> GROUP_CONCAT: concatenate the string version of the values using
  coma as separator
  <li> MEDIAN: median of the column values.  Note that this function can
  not be evaluated progressively.  Any select clause including this
  function will require all intermediate values to be stored in memory
  before this function can be evaluated.  This can significantly
  increase the memory requirement and may lead to <code>ibis</code> to
  run out of memory and crash!
</ul>

<p>
The key word FROM must be followed by a list of table names.
Conceptually, the data under the management of IBIS are organized into
tables; and each table must have a name.  The table names in this clause
may contain wild cards, '%' and '_', where '%' matches zero or more any
characters and '_' matches exactly one character as in SQL "LIKE"
expression.  If no table name is specified, the key word FROM must not
be used.  In which case, all know data table would be queried.

<p>
The key word WHERE must be followed by a set of range conditions joined
by logical operators 'AND', 'OR', 'XOR', and '!'.  A range condition
can be one-sided as "A = 5" or "B > 10", or two-sided as "10 <= B < 20."
The supported operators are = (alternatively ==), <, <=, >, and >=.  The
range condition that involves only one attribute with constant bounds are
known as simple conditions, which can be very efficiently processed by
IBIS.  A range condition can also involve multiple attributes, such as,
"A < B <= 5", or even arithmetic expressions, such as, "sin(A) + fabs(B)
< sqrt(cx*cx+cy*cy)".  Note all one-argument and two-argument arithmetic
functions available in <code>math.h</code> are supported.  The key word
WHERE and the conditions following it are essential to a query and can
<b>not</b> be ommited.

<p>
The select clause may also contain arithmetic expressions, e.g.,
<pre>
-q "select pressure, sqrt(vx*vx+vy*vy+vz*vz) where temperature > 1000"
</pre>

<p>
A select clause of "count(*)" will produce a result table of exactly one
row and one column as dictacted by the SQL standard.  One would have to
examine the content of this trivial table to find out exactly how many
hits are produced.  To bypass this extra step, simply omitting the
select clause in this case.

<p>
The key word ORDER BY is optional.  If it appears, it can only be
followed by list of column names, no wild cards, no arithmetic
function.  Furthermore, the column names in the ORDER BY clause must be
a subset of columns specified as output from the SELECT clause.

<h2><A name="output">Sample output</A></h2>
Here is a sample output produced on October 17, 2014 using the sample
data star2002.  The following sample output is produced in the directory
tests.

<pre>
$ scripts/star2002.sh
  <<<...output skipped...>>>

</pre>

<p>
The number of hits is printed in the following line
<pre>
From star2002 Where 2900 < primaryTracks --> 20
</pre>

<p>
The SELECT clause produced the output with the following
heading.
<pre>
Query LT55J4AkJu400000 produces 32 distinct tuples of columns mchn,tmpr
</pre>

<p>
In this particular case, it prints the machine name with the abnormal
temperature, 'MegaBACE # MB 424', and the abnormal temperature values,
which incidentally all appears to be multiple of 8.
