%description
FastBit is an open-source data processing library following the spirit
of NoSQL movement. It offers a set of searching functions supported by
compressed bitmap indexes. It treats user data in the column-oriented
fashion similar to well-known database management systems such as Sybase
IQ, MonetDB, and Vertica. It is designed to accelerate user's data
selection tasks without imposing undue requirements. In particular, the
user data is NOT required to be under the control of FastBit software.
