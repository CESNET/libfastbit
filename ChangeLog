2009-12-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/readcsv.cpp: prefix the column names with comment
	characters to allow other CSV reader to correctly read the CSV
	file too, change the string type from text to category (to allow
	indexing and searching)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add check-maurel to exercise the test data
	and queries contributed by Alexandre Maurel

2009-12-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bord.cpp: update bord::part::groupby to work with count(*)
	as a term in the select clause
	* src/bundle.h, src/bundle.cpp: allow count(*) in the select
	clauses, consolidate ibis::bundles::sort and ibis::bundles::sort2
	* src/util.h, src/query.cpp: remove class ibis::selected (replaced
	with ibis::selectClause)
	* src/bundle.cpp: replace ibis::selected with ibis::nameList in
	function bundles::tuncate and bundles::reorder
	* src/selectParser.ll: add keyword countdistinct
	* test/Makefile.am: change test case 7 to avoid in-line editing of
	output file
	* src/util.cpp: change ibis::util::strMatch to make sure an empty
	string can match the wild character '%' (zero or more of any
	character - a problem reported by Jan Hapke)

2009-12-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h:214 construtor of qContinuous assigned operations to
	the wrong side (a problem reported by Jan Hapke)
	* src/countQuery.cpp:45 change conds.getString() to simply conds
	(to make use of the operator<< defined in whereClause.h) to avoid
	the problem with getString() returning nil pointer (which happens
	when the query expression is directly passed in from the caller)

2009-12-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bundle.h, src/bundle.cpp: add function bundles::sort2 to
	handle the cases where the aggregation functions appear in the
	middle of the select clause (the previous attempt to address this
	issue on 12-10 neglected to move the aggregation functions with
	the column values, and therefore produces the incorrect result.
	Problem reported by Jan Hapke)

2009-12-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.cpp: make sure ierr is set for LOGICAL_NOT operator
	(address a problem reported by Alexandre Maurel)
	* src/array_t.cpp: change nosharing to make a copy when m_begin !=
	actual->begin()
	* src/fileManager.cpp: constructor of fileManager::rofSegment
	neglected to record the memory it allocated (address a problem
	reported by Jan Hapke)
	* win/*.vcproj: restore the Debug configurations to use Debug
	options (they were accidentally change to use Release options)

2009-12-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bundle.cpp: add code to temporarily move the aggregation
	functions to the end of the list of columns for easier sorting (to
	address the problem with aggregations appears before the group-by
	keys in the selected clause observed by Jan Hapke)
	* src/util.h: consolidate the checking of atomic operations on
	windows platforms
	* src/selectClause.h: rename innerName to argName and outerName to
	termName
	* win/trydll.cpp: replace ibis::selected with ibis::selectClause

2009-12-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: move the mutex lock outside to the caller
	because most of the callers have already a mutex lock, which
	causes dead lock
	* src/whereParser.yy: introduce special cases of operator IN
	involving string literals (to address a problem reported by
	Alexandre Maurel)
	* src/qExpr.h: add qLike to represent the operator Like
	* src/whereLexer.ll, src/whereParser.yy: add LIKEOP and defintion
	of operator LIKE
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp, src/query.cpp,
	src/countQuery.cpp, src/whereClause.cpp: update to work with
	ibis::qLike through ibis::util::strMatch

2009-12-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win/win.Mak: remove '-o' from commands that build object files,
	visual studio has deprecated -o
	* src/array_t.cpp:301 check for nil m_begin or m_end
	* src/bitvector.cpp: 454 check for nil m_vec.begin() or
	m_vec.end()
	* src/*.cpp: address issues raised by g++ -Wall, only warnings
	left should be unused variables starting with g, which are
	ibis::util::guard objects meant to be automatically cleaned by the
	compiler
	* src/fileManager.cpp: comment out line 1161 and 1162 to prevent
	duplicate calls to fileManager::increaseUse, consolidate the
	recording of files in getFile and tryGetFile with recordFile
	(previous version may record roFile objects that have been deleted)

2009-12-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.cpp: change util::userName to prefer getpwuid_r, add
	call to delete the object pass (under valgrind, this variable is
	always shown as lost)

2009-12-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h, src/qExpr.cpp: change all 'inline virtual'
	functions to virtual functions (without inlining) (an attempt to
	reduce the linking problems on cygwin with gcc)

2009-12-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp: change the default option in printFull to call
	the print function, change the defaul options in both print and
	printFull to use the output stream given by Jochen Schlosser
	* src/fileManager.cpp, src/fileManager.h: remove
	fileManager::mutexLock, use ibis::util::mutexLock instead
	* src/part.h, src/parti.h, src/part.cpp: add function emptyCache,
	replace ibis::part::mutexLock with ibis::util::mutexLock
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: move function freeMemory from
	array_t.h to array_t.cpp, add log statements to match the log
	statement in the constructors

2009-12-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: change tablex::readNamesAndTypes to read
	-part.txt as well, change ibis::tafel::writeMetaData to write the
	columns in the order given on input
	* src/whereLexer.ll: change return type of {QUOED} to STRLIT
	(return the return type of the number sequence to NUMSEQ as it
	should be, the previous modfication was incorrect)
	* src/whereParse.yy: uncomment the rules for producing
	ibis::qString, modify the rule on line 419 to provide a
	work-around for the shift/reduce conflict
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test cases for "index = none"
	* src/bitvector.cpp: invoke nosharing on m_vec in all four
	versions of bitwise logical operations that modifies the left-hand
	side (only operator-= was doing it in some cases).  This might
	address the problem reported by Jochen Schlosser because the
	modified mask vector may still be using a map of the old mask file.

2009-12-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: generate Makefile in contrib/fbmerge
	* INSTALL: add note about floating-point value variations, remove
	note about valgrind warning

2009-12-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/selectClause.cpp:10 move assignment of clause_ to the body
	of the constructor to avoid problem with input argument being a
	nil pointer
	* src/query.cpp:2463 change else if block to else block to always
	initialize the bitvector mask
	* src/query.cpp:340-344 compute verified with sc (instead of
	comps)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add a new test case 5 to check-text to test
	the new order by functionality (requested by Jan Hapke)
	* contrib: add contrib directory to cvs/svn along with fbmerge.cpp
	from Luca Deri

2009-11-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp: consolidate two nearly identical versions of
	ibis::table::select
	* src/selectClause.h: add a constructor that takes
	ibis::table::stringList
	* src/bord.h, src/bord.cpp: change ibis::bord::part::groupby to
	take ibis::selectClause as argument instead of a list of strings
	(to better handle the aliases)
	* src/query.h, src/query.cpp: replace ibis::select with
	ibis::selectClause (to consolidate handling of select clauses)

2009-11-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bord.cpp: include typeinfo to add compilation problem with
	gcc 4.4.x (a problem reported by Jan Hapke)

2009-11-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/utilidor.cpp: add try-catch block in util::sortStrings
	* examples/ibis.cpp:3997 add statements to work with order by
	clauses with ASC and DESC keywords but without LIMIT clause (a
	problem reported by Jan Hapke)
	* src/bord.cpp: in bord::column::reverseRows and
	bord::column::limit add code to handle string values
	* src/colValues.cpp: in two versions of colStrings::sort, change
	sep from std::string& to std::string
	* tests/Makefile.am: add keyword DESC to the order by clause used
	in check-marsdb case 3 (to verify the problem reported by Jan is
	fixed)
	* src/bundle.cpp:1627 i <= ngroups should be i < ngroups
	(otherwise it writes to an element beyond the allocated memory for
	starts)
	* tests/marksdb-3: update the file to correct printout

2009-11-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bord.cpp: add function ibis::bord::part::sortStrings, rename
	some reorderValues that actually performs sorting to sortValues

2009-11-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/selectParser.yy, src/whereParser.yy: change the
	associativities of unary operators +, - and ! (not) to be right
	associative following the common convention.  This also addresses
	the problem reported by Andrew Olson about failure to parse
	expression "stop-start+1"
	* src/whereLexer.ll: change the return type of quoted string
	literal from NOUNSTR to STRSEQ to ensure that the quoted strings
	are recognized as string literals.  This addresses the problem
	reported by Alexandre Maurel where the value of a string literal
	is also the name of another column.

2009-11-21 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: change doQuery to directly use an
	ibis::bundle object (instead of routing the function calls through
	the query object).  This addresses the issue on the order by
	clause and the limit clause raised by Jan Hapke (but only for
	queries not invoving any arithmetic expressions or aggregation
	functions).

2009-11-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/colValues.cpp: an incorrect use of
	std::vector<std::string>::reference causes it to overwrite some
	values, which was the cause of a problem observed by Jan Hapke
	* examples/ibis.cpp: modify doAppend to check whether the second
	argument to -a is a directory name (to mimic a utility function
	written by Luca Deri)
	* examples/ibis.cpp: neglected to check the error code returned by
	query::orderby and query::limit, which is the source of a couple of
	problems reported by Jan Hapke.  Modify parseString to bypass the
	problems.
	* src/mensa.cpp: the function ibis::table::parseNames neglected
	the underscore '_'

2009-11-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/array_t.cpp: in function nosharing, change the test to use
	filename() != 0 instead of isFileMap() because named files are
	tracked by the file manager and may be shared with others later
	* src/bundle.cpp, src/colValues.cpp: add calls to nosharing before
	modifying the content of the bundle or column values (to address
	an issue raised by Alexandre Maurel)

2009-11-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixfuzz.cpp:51-52 remove statements that blindly refers to
	offset32

	implementation of function segment to address the issue raised by
	Alexandre Maurel

	hit1+1 to hit1 in function evaluate

2009-11-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixambit.cpp, src/ixpack.cpp, src/ixpale.cpp, src/ixzone.cpp:
	capture the return from writing the elements of sub
	* src/irange.cpp:529 change 4*(nobs+1) to sizeof(int64_t)*(nobs+1)
	* src/bitvector.cpp:3285, src/bitvector64:2503 replace call to
	flip with explict code to flip the bits in m_vec, the function
	flip also turns the active bits which need to be handled
	separately in this case
	* src/islice.cpp, src/ifade.cpp: write32 and write64 mistakenly
	used nbos in places of card
	* src/ibin.cpp:484 the starting position of the offsets should be
	8+2*sizeof(uint32_t) not 8+sizeof(uint32_t)
	* src/imesa.cpp: remove mesa::write32 and mesa::write64, they are
	the same as bin::write32 and bin::write64
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:1220 add case for when c1 is in the unrecorded bin

2009-11-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

	* src/icegale.cpp: in function read(storage*) update computation
	of offsets and add code for cnts
	* src/ixzona.cpp:611 offset32 should be offset64
	* src/ibin.cpp:5126 sizeof(int32_t) should be sizeof(int64_t)
	* src/ixpale.cpp:509 sizeof(int32_t) should be sizeof(int64_t)
	* src/islice.cpp: functions write32 and write64 handles offsets
	incorrectly
	* src/ixpack.cpp:519 change sizeof(int32_t) to sizeof(int64_t)
	* src/ibin.cpp: change ibis::bin::write to call bin::write32 and
	write64
	* src/irange.cpp: change ibis::range::write to use write32 and
	write64, correct the statement in write64 that actually write the
	64-bit offsets
	* src/imesa.cpp: change ibis::mesa::write to use write32 and
	write64 to reduce the code size

2009-11-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/capi.cpp, src/fileManager.cpp, src/tafel.cpp,
	examples/thula.cpp: get rid off warnings issued by g++ compiler
	* src/ixzone.cpp: in the constructor from a storage object,
	mistakenly placed the offsets for the next level into offset64 and
	offset32
	* src/irange.cpp:461, src/irelic.cpp:549, src/islice.cpp:451,
	src/ixbylt.cpp:2073, src/ixfuzz.cpp:381, src/ixpack.cpp:687 change
	sizeof(int32_t) to header[6], corrects address computations
	* src/ixfuge.cpp: in two version of read function, many instances
	of offset32 should be offset64

2009-11-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.h: change copy_runs and copy_runsn to chech the
	values of nw before calling run::decode.  This avoids the warnings
	from valgrind and make it a little easier to debug the rest of the
	code.
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:1224 cbounds[0] should be cbounds[c0]
	* src/ixbylt.cpp: check the value of c0 in casues where c0-1 and
	c0-2 are used as indices to arrays (in functions evaluate and
	estimateCost)

2009-11-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/i*.cpp: add compiler macro FASTBIT_USE_LONG_OFFSETS to force
	it to always use 64-bit bitmap offsets (even if the index sizes
	are small)
	* INSTALL: add a note about FASTBIT_USE_LONG_OFFSETS
	* src/ixfuge.cpp:1574 offset64.size() > cbits.size() should be
	coffset64.size() > cbits.size()
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:669 coffset64.size() > bits.size() should be
	offset64.size() > bits.size()
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:1131 add condition c1-1 < ncoarse, the coarse bin
	may be the unrecorded bin, which means cbits[c1-1] is not defined
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:853,1346 the branch for 64-bit offsets mistakenly used
	32-bit offsets
	* src/ixbylt.cpp: in functions estimateCost and evaluate, move the
	case for handling unrecorded bin up the list of if blocks

2009-11-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bundle.cpp:1706 same problem as identified by Luca

2009-11-01 Luca Deri <deri at ntop.org>
	* src/bundle.cpp:1416 change cols[i] to cols[j].  The incorrect
	index to cols causes core dump

	add aggregate functions stdpop, stdsamp, varpop, varsamp, and
	distinct to the select clause

2009-10-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixpale.cpp: in function write32 and write64, update the
	computation of offset32[0] and offset64[0]
	* src/icegale.cpp: in functions write32 and write64, the offsets
	array need to have nbits+1 elements not nobs+1 elements

2009-10-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ifade.cpp: in function write, update the value of header[6].
	in functions write32 and write64, update the computation of
	position of the 1st bitmap
	* src/irange.cpp:472 the element size should be 4 instead of 8
	* src/icegale.cpp:416, src/icfuge.cpp:253 header[6] was entered
	wrongly
	* src/ixfuge.cpp, src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, src/ixzona.cpp:
	change the function write to detect whether a coarse level index
	is actually present before calling the function to write the
	coarse level indexes
	* src/ixbylt.cpp:215 should call reserve not resize
	* src/horometer.h: add information about MinGW.  It has
	sys/timer.h, but not sys/resource.h

2009-10-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/i*.cpp: many write functions neglected to initialize the
	new offset32 and offset64 to the proper size before using them
	* src/ixbylt.cpp: writeCoarse32 and writeCoarse64 used offset32
	and offset64 instead of coffset32 and coffset64
	* src/index.cpp: update all versions of activate function to use
	LOGGER for messages
	* src/idirekte.cpp, src/ikeywords.cpp: invoked initOffsets with
	wrong start address

	* src/ibin.h, src/ixfuge.cpp: add coffset64 to ibis::fuge, rename
	coffsets to coffset32

2009-10-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

2009-10-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.h, src/irange.cpp: modify ibis::range class

2009-10-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* doc/contact.html: add new contact information

2009-10-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.h, src/util.h: move the macro HAVE_FILE_MAP and
	FASTBIT_MIN_MAP_SIZE to util.h to be accessible to more files
	* src/ibin.h, src/ibin.cpp: modified ibis::bin class to use
	offset64 and offset32 at the same time

2009-10-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.h, src/fileManager.cpp: change size information
	for ibis::storage to be stored in a size_t (instead of a uint32_t)
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: change size related variables
	from uint32_t to size_t, but keep sorting functions using uint32_t
	for indices (add statements to check that uint32_t is sufficient
	for the tasks)
	* src/index.h, src/index.cpp: add member variable offset64
	* src/colValues.h, src/colValues.cpp: change all lengths and sizes
	from uint32_t to size_t

2009-10-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src: use the refactoring capability of eclipse to rename
	index::offsets to index::ofset32, in preparation of adding
	index::offset64

2009-10-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibis.h, src/index.h: add warning about index size limitation

	keywords meta tags to all html pages
	* doc/footer.html: add google custom search to the end of all html
	documents generated by doxygen

2009-09-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: change the square bracket for defaults in
	AS_HELP_STRING to parentheses (avoids problem with autoconf);
	regenerate configure with "aclocal-1.11 && automake-1.11 &&
	autoconf-2.64"

2009-09-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h, src/column.cpp, src/tafel.cpp: add new macro
	OPEN_WRITEADD and use it in function append with fix-sized
	columns, change the macro OPEN_WRITEONLY to OPEN_WRITENEW to
	indicate that it truncates existing file and is intended to write
	new files.  The append operation was using OPEN_APPENDONLY which
	was always adding new bytes, but the append operation may need to
	overwrite certain existing bytes.  The earlier attempt to change
	them to OPEN_WRITEONLY has caused the existing data to be wiped
	out (an error discovered with regression testing).
	* src/tafel.cpp: in function writeRaw, add statments to write the
	initial 0 to the .sp file, add statement to ensure the correct
	totmask before adding newmask, add function preferredSize to
	compute the number of rows to store in memory based on available
	memory
	* src/category.cpp: add error checking to ibis::text::readString

	readSQLDump to write content when running out of memory
	* src/mensa.cpp: update cursor::fillBuffers and cursor::fillBuffer
	to reflect the fact that the bufferElements are no longer storing
	fileManager::storage objects but array_t objects instead

2009-09-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: add blobsnames and blobsvalues to ibis::table::row,
	note this version of ibis::table::row use std::string to hold
	blobs, which may have problems with null characters on some
	systems
	* src/mensa.h, src/mensa.cpp: add starts to
	ibis::mensa::cursor::bufferElement, use void* for both starts and
	cval (use the same type convention for cval as that of
	ibis::tafel::column)
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp: add function getBlob and two
	versions of readBlob

2009-09-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp, src/category.cpp, src/column.cpp: change opening
	mode from OPEN_APPENDONLY to OPEN_READWRITE for all .sp files,
	change some OPEN_APPENDONLY to OPEN_WRITEONLY because those
	functions may move the file pointers from the end of the file to
	somewhere in the middle of the file in case of unexpected file
	sizes

2009-09-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: add minimal processing of column type set in
	function createSQLTable, add handling of BLOB to most functions,
	add handling of default for missing values

2009-09-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ardea.cpp: add code to invoke readSQLDump

2009-09-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.h: add fileManager::buffer<T>::swap, hide copy
	constructor and assignment operator
	* src/table.h: remove ibis::tablex::SQLCreateTable, add
	ibis::tablex::readSQLDump
	* src/tafel.h, src/tafel.cpp: implement readSQLDump with functions
	SQLCreateTable and readSQLStatement

2009-09-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/*.h, src/*.cpp: change all size_t back to uint32_t because
	size_t some how is not one of intxx_t on cygwin -- my main
	development environment.  In addition, there were ealier user
	request to keep certain return values in uint32_t instead of
	size_t.  The attempt to make array_t store more than 2^32 elements
	is abandoned and should not be attempted again with this code
	base!
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: update push_back and three
	versions of insert to use the copy-and-swap idiom if new space is
	needed, add check for array size over 2^31

2009-08-31 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/colValues.h, src/colValues.cpp, utilidor.h, utilidor.cpp:
	change array indices from uint32_t to size_t following the changes
	to array_t

2009-08-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.cpp: add functions extractAll and extractSome to
	ibis::blob

2009-08-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: change type of sizes from
	uint32_t to size_t, difference_type to ptrdiff_t (use c++ header
	cstddef).  The intention is to make array size go beyond 2^32
	elements.

2009-08-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: add column type BLOB
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp: add column type ibis::blob
	* src/util.h: add ibis::util::guard, ibis::util::makeGuard and
	supporting functions to implement objects for clean up after
	resources such as file pointers.  This is to simply the handling
	of file pointers used in functions such as ibis::blob::append.
	* src/colValues.cpp: rearrange the loops in all versions of
	ibis::colValues::segement to initialize the segmentation process
	within each existing segement, to address an issue reported by
	Alexandre Maurel <alexandre dot maurel at gmail dot com>, who also
	provided a fix ibis::colFloats::segement

2009-08-27 Alexandre Maurel <alexandre dot maurel at gmail dot com>
	* src/colValues.cpp: fix ibis::colFloats::segment to correct
	handle existing segments with the same values

2009-08-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/mensa.h, src/mensa.cpp: rename
	ibis::mensa::computeHits to ibis::table::computeHits, rename
	ibis::mensa::doSelect to ibis::table::select.  Move the list of
	data partitions to the from of the argument lists in these two
	functions.  This change addresses a need brought up by Andrew
	Olson.
	* src/table.h, src/mensa.h: add a version of table::select and
	table::computeHits that accept qExpr directly
	* examples/thula.cpp: add a minimal test for the class functions
	ibis::table::select
	* src/table.h: add versions of the member function
	ibis::table::estiamte and ibis::table::select to take query
	expression in the form of ibis::qExpr*.

2009-08-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h: change values in ibis::qDiscreteRange and
	ibis::qAnyAny from type std::vector<double> to
	ibis::array_t<double> to better track the memory usage, change
	related functions to use the new data type
	* src/table.h: add function getPartitions to return a list of
	ibis::part
	* src/bitvector.h: modify all 8 versions of bitwise logical
	operators to make sure the two operands represent the same number
	of bits (to address problems reported by David Reynolds < David
	dot Reynolds at 3ds dot com>)
	* src/bitvector.h: rename setSize to sloppySize and clarify its
	functionality in doxygen documents

2009-08-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: clarify that ibis::tablex::write also updates
	metadata

2009-08-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h:1173 change abs to fabs, apparently fabs is the only
	name guaranteed to work on double values, the function abs may be
	resolved to work with integers on some versions of libm

2009-08-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp: print the result from function ibis::bin::locate
	* src/util.h: update to the implementation of util::coarsen to
	cope with round-off errors that may cause the same value to come
	out differently, for example, 1e-14 and 10 x 1e-15 are observed to
	come out slightly differently.

2009-08-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/idbak2.cpp:998 change && to || (this error can cause crashes
	on some machines)

2009-08-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/idbak2.cpp: add bit vector to capture the locations of
	values exactly equal to the low-precision target value.  This is
	necessary to make the index resolve all boundary bonditions
	involve low-precision values without needing candidate checks.
	The previous implementation can resolve conditions such as "A >=
	a" and "a <= A < b", but not "A = a", "A <= a", or "a <= A <= b".
	* win/Win.mak, win/MinGW.mak: update the dependencies in the make
	files
	* src/util.cpp: change the constructor of ibis::util::timer to
	only print a message if gVerbose level is no less than lvl+2
	* src/selectClause.h, src/selectClause.cpp: add function to verify
	some terms (instead of all terms)
	* src/mensa.cpp:587 verify only those terms that are used for
	retrieving values from the original data (which make it possible
	to use aliases defined earlier in the select clauses)
	* src/selectParser.yy: add special aggregator function
	"count(*)".  Note: since the keyword "unique" is not supported,
	all count() function calls are treated as "count(*)"!

2009-08-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: move the statement that increment idxcnt and
	decrement idxcnt to be under the protection of a read lock on the
	column to avoid possible confusion about the idxcnt in function
	unloadIndex.  This and the change from yesterday together address
	the issue of deadlock when the cleaner is invoked while activating
	new bitmap of the bitmap index.  Because the activate function
	holds a mutex lock which prevent the acquisition of mutex lock in
	functioin unload.

2009-08-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp:4786 remove the mutex lock from column::unloadIndex

2009-07-31 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth*.cpp: in function adaptivexDBins, decrement the scaling
	factor after inversion to ensure it is small enough to never cause
	the indices computed to be out of bounds.  The out of bounds
	indices appared to be the root cause of the problem of the crashes
	reported by Andrew Olson.
	* src/parth*.cpp: replace all instances of ibis::query with
	ibis::countQuery (which is simpler than ibis::query class)

2009-07-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp: change the print statements in qExpr::simplify
	and qExpr::reorder to use the same verboseness level
	* src/query.cpp, src/countQuery.cpp: neglected to set the proper
	return values when comparing strings
	* src/parth*.cpp: explicitly pass the argument false to function
	query::evaluate

2009-07-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth*.cpp: add ibis::CATEGORY to cases for ibis::UINT.
	This allows categorical values to be used in histogram functions.
	Previously, only some of the cases for UINT has CATEGORY as well.
	The inconsistency was revealed after Andrew Olson raised the
	question about possibility of using categorical values in
	histograms.
	* win/MinGW.mak: change column type of t1/c from short to ushort
	to match the changes in tests/Makefile.am

2009-07-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/irelic.cpp: change estimateCost to attempt to use bits
	directly if offsets is not available
	* src/countQuery.cpp: update doScan and doEvaluate to correct
	error involving query conditions that return no hit (the same
	problems in query.cpp were fixed on 7/16), make doScan and
	doEvaluate consistently return the number of hits

2009-07-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.cpp: util::isortRIDs to util::sortRIDsi, fix leftover
	problems with function names in utilidor.cpp
	* src/index.cpp:7140 remove the if-block that preventing basis
	size 2 being used, add case to handle base size 2 for all
	components

2009-07-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.cpp: doEvaluate and doScan handled the LOGICAL_AND
	operator incorrectly, when no hit is found, it neglected to set
	the result bitvector, which causes other expressions to produce
	incorrect answers (apparently, this is the root cuase of the
	problem reported by Jochen Schlosser)
	* tests/scripts/query-count.list: add empty conditions to exercise
	the changes in query.cpp
	* src/qExpr.h, src/qExpr.cpp: change print function to only print
	one node, rename old print function (that recursively prints the
	whole express tree) to printFull, removed qExpr::printRange
	* src/category.cpp: call prepareMembers in category::selectUInts
	(without it, the program ibis occasionally crashes)
	* src/array_t.cpp: check for k being 0 in topk and bottomk,
	initialize the array ind before calling qsort in topk and bottomk
	(the zero value of k causes crashes in bottomk)
	* src/bundles.cpp: in versions of truncate, make sure keep > 0

2009-07-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp: in doSelect limit the number of characters from
	cond is placed in de (to reduce the length of the new table)
	* src/column.cpp: two versions of function selectValuesT
	negelected to close fdes
	* src/bord.h: ibis::bord::cursor::dumpIJ needs to cast char and
	unsigned char to integers before printing to ensure they are
	printed as integers

2009-07-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp, src/bord.cpp: change group by operation involving
	categorical values to use the integer representation instead of
	the strings (should be faster than using strings)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test case to check-text to exercise group
	by on categorical values
	* src/bundle.cpp: add statements to check for nil pointers

2009-07-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp: clean up the documentation
	about members of ibis::dictionary and consolidate the null strings
	into a single class variable ibis::dictionary::nullstring.
	* src/colValues.h: add colStrings
	* src/colValues.cpp: change all bubble sort code to use selection
	sort to minimize the data movement
	* src/bord.cpp: change bord::groupby to make use of the new
	colStrings for TEXT and CATEGORY.  This makes it possible to
	perform group by with string valued columns through ibis::table
	interface (Andrew Olson needed this feature)

2009-07-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* INSTALL: clean up the file
	* src/category.cpp: delay reading of dictionary and generating .sp
	file as much as possible, define macro FASTBIT_EAGER_INIT_TEXT if
	eager initialization is desired

2009-07-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: modify round_down and round_up to check for input
	value out of the range of output value (with the use of
	std::numeric_limits template) (to address an issue raised by
	Jochen Schlosser)
	* tests/Makefile.am: change the type of c from short to unsigned
	short in t0 and t1, add query boundaries involving negative
	numbers to catch the error reported by Jochen Schlosser
	* src/whereClause.h, src/whereClause.cpp: add function
	standardizeRange to deal with negative boundaries in range
	expressions involving unsigned integer columns
	* src/idirekte.cpp: update function locate to work better with
	ranges including negative boundaries
	* src/part.cpp: add code in template part::doScan and
	part::doCount to modify the bounds and operators in case the input
	boundaries are out of valid range of the data types, add
	specificalization for float and double for template part::doScan
	and part::doCount

2009-07-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.h: add ibis::liga as a simple container of externally
	managed data partitions, it provides the ibis::table API but does
	NOT manage the resources associated with the data partitions.

2009-06-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/thula.cpp: expand the doxygen documentatation about the
	program
	* src/parti.cpp: modify part::purgeInactive to use the new
	function saveSelected
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test 4 to check-marksdb to exercise
	group-by functions, add test 4 and 5 to check-text to excercise
	the function to deactivate rows
	* examples/ibis.cpp: update doxygen documentation

2009-06-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/const.h: change macro DIRSEP to FASTBIT_DIRSEP
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp: add functions
	text::saveSelected and text::writeStrings to wrie selected string
	values

2009-06-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: change the constructor fileManager::roFile
	so that it is only usable by friends, change macro
	FILEMANAGER_UNLOAD_TIME to FASTBIT_UNLOAD_LIMIT, MIN_DOMAP_SIZE to
	FASTBIT_MIN_MAP_SIZE
	* src/i*.cpp: change the macro ALWAY_READ_BITVECTOR0 to
	FASTBIT_READ_BITVECTOR0 (the word always was misspelled anyway)
	* src/mensa.cpp: in doSelect collect data only from unique columns
	* src/bord.cpp: in the constructor of ibis::bord::part delete the
	buf of duplicate names (buffer associated with duplicate names are
	lost, a problem report by Shane Adams)

2009-06-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/array_t.cpp: change the constructor of ibis::array_t that
	takes storage& to take storage* (to match the other one that
	already accepts storage*, having one of them taking storage& and
	the other taking sotrage* is confusing to be sure)

2009-06-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.cpp: in function subset, try to avoid access nil
	pointer (to address a problem reported by Jochen Schlosser)

2009-06-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.cpp:1185 add test for currentDataDir() to prevent
	strcmp from using nil pointer (a problem reported by Jochen
	Schlosser)
	* src/part.cpp:346 remove test on nEvent to generate m_name
	regardless of the value of nEvents
	* src/part.cpp: add check for nEvents being zero in functions that
	deactivates rows

2009-06-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: writeMetaData check the validity of activeDir
	before write it as alternative directory
	* examples/thula.cpp:607 allow the selection to be printed without
	-v option

2009-06-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* doc/dataLoading.html: add note about support for unsigned
	integers
	* src/array_t.h: update documentation about the class to reflect
	the change in name space (notice by Matthias Vallentin)
	* src/part.h: change nEvent from type size_t to uint32_t
	* src/column.cpp: in function append (that takes directory name as
	input), remove the dependencies on thePart->currentDataDir (a
	problem reported by Jochen Schlosser)

2009-06-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.cpp:1216 add check for state of the partition
	before truncating the data file and .sp file in
	ibis::text::startPositions (a problem noticed by Jochen Schlosser)
	* src/array_t.h: put array_t template into namespace ibis (a
	change requested by Matthias Vallentin)

2009-06-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: add optional argument to ibis::tablex::addColumn
	and ibis::tablex::write to specify indexing options, add function
	ibis::tablex::writeMetaData
	* src/part.cpp: remove the special case for creating new directory
	from the constructor that takes two directory names as arguments
	* src/ibis.h: update the acknowledgement section in the doxygen
	documentation
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: move the decision of whether to
	load index under a mutex lock in the constructor of indexLock and
	in function loadIndex.  This should prevent an thread from using a
	partially constructed index (being created by another thread)

2009-06-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.cpp:2549 change the test to use sampled histogram in
	more cases (in a case with 20 million unique values, the histogram
	data structure caused segmentation violations)

2009-06-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: print the error code if the query evaluation fails
	in ibis_part_threadedTestFun2
	* src/category.cpp: add timer to text::startPositions
	* src/column.cpp: add log statements to the constructors to pair
	up with the log statement in the destructor

2009-06-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: in column::getNullMask comparisons involving
	mask.size() need to taking into account of the state of data
	partition.  This is the root cause of the problem observed by
	Jochen Schlosser.  A better solution might be to create indexes
	without the use of null masks.
	* src/util.cpp: clean up the log message from util::removeDir,
	if the argument leaveDir is set, do not remove the subdirectories
	either (when used from ibis::part and ibis::query, only the files
	in the current current directories need to be removed, the
	subdirectories should be saved)
	* src/ixbylt.cpp: bylt::evaluate used c0 incorrectly when the
	query range is open to the right side
	* src/*.cpp: remove the integer constants passed to the
	constructor of ibis::util::logger class to make the printout more
	uniform
	* src/util.h, src/util.cpp: change util::uniqueNumber to
	util::serialNumber and use sharedInt32 instead of explicitly using
	a mutex lock

2009-06-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: warn about file size over 2GB in
	ibis::column::append, simplify the logic regarding the existing
	mask file
	* src/column.cpp update column::mask_ in column::append to address
	a problem reported by Jochen Schlosser
	* src/part.cpp: in function init, check parameter useBackupDir

2009-06-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp: constructors of qDiscreteRange negelcted to set
	the type of the expression
	* src/qExpr.h: change qRange to not set query expression type, add
	code to set query expression type in all constructors of
	ibis::qContinuousRange

2009-06-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: change return value of ibis::table::addPartition to
	return the number of partitions found on success (instead of
	returning 0)

2009-06-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: clarify the logic of tablex::reserveSpace
	* src/tafel.h, src/tafel.cpp: add function doReserve and
	reimplement reserveSpace by calling doReserve, make reserveSpace
	more robust, add documentation about the function

2009-06-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/script/fastbit-config.in: add new file to report the
	compilation flags

2009-05-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp, src/parti.cpp: examine the logic of assigning the
	initial state in the constructor of ibis::part to address a
	question raised by Jochen Schlosser
	* src/utilidor.cpp: add explicit template instantiations for
	sortKeys with array_t<ibis::rid_t> as payload (make it easier to
	perform joins outside of FastBit code)

2009-05-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: print the names of files as they being
	removed by fileManager::flushFile and fileManager::flushDir when
	the verbose level is larger than 7

2009-05-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: in column::appendValues and
	column::appendStrings, add UnixClose to close the file and add
	statements to write the mask fo the column

2009-05-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: in both versions of tafel::appendRow, only
	increment mrows if all fields have been added, change normalize to
	compute the value of mrows, in appendRow that takes
	ibis::table::row, call normalize only if the number of columns is
	the same as the number of column of the current data partition
	(otherwise only work with the few columns indicated in the
	incoming data structure)
	* src/table.h: add function table::row::nColumns
	* src/tafel.cpp:717 add a line to capture the new mask found
	through name matching

2009-05-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.cpp: extend util::charTable to contain 65 characters
	instead of 64 just in case someone is using the util::charIndex as
	indices into util::charTable
	* src/tafel.h: change the definition of tafel::column from
	protected to public to make it possible to directly access the
	in-memory columns
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: add a new variant of function
	append with two functions appendValues and appendString to direct
	add values to the active data file

2009-05-21 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/array_t.cpp: replace all calls to util::logMessage with
	calls to LOGGER

2009-05-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.cpp: add ibis::tablex::readNamesAndTypes
	and ibis::tablex::parseNamesAndTypes, implement them in
	src/tafel.cpp, addressing an issue of column names not accepting
	underscore (a problem first reported by Nicolae Mihalache <mache
	at abcpages dot com>)
	* examples/ardea.cpp: add option -M to accept a metadata file name
	for metadata that includes a large number of columns (to
	accomodate the need to read metadata of wide tables)

2009-05-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.h: change tablex::nRows to tablex::mRows,
	tablex::nColumns to tablex::mColumns to avoid possible name
	conflict when table and tablex are used together
	* tests/readcsv.cpp:298 add check for buf == 0 after call to new
	* src/fileManager.h: add function resize to
	ibis::fileManager::buffer, add call to initialize file manager in
	function fileManager::byteFree
	* src/tafel.cpp: in tafel::readCSV increase the size of linebuf to
	accomodate data files with wide rows (a problem first reported by
	Nicolae Mihalache <mache at abcpages dot com>)

2009-05-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: add more print statements to tafel::write
	* configure.ac: rename src/config.h.in to
	src/fastbit-config.h.in (effectively renamed config.h to
	fastbit-config.h, something suggested by Hank Childs, but was
	neglected earlier)

2009-05-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/Makefile.am: capture the return code of ibis and print it
	out in cases of error (in large-append-test)
	* src/irange.cpp:3206 add case for empty upper bound
	* all: marked current files as ibis1.0.9

2009-05-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixpack.cpp, src/ixpale.cpp, src/ixambit.cpp, src/zone.cpp:
	neglected to handle the case where cand0 >= cand1 (no hit); when
	both left operator and right operator are undefined, change return
	value of the function estimate to empty bitmpas instead of
	undefined values
	* src/ixpack.cpp: in estimate when the left operator is <= and
	right operator is <=, the right boundary is not handled correctly
	* src/ibin.cpp: tests bin1 > nobs should be bin1 >= nobs
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp, src/parti.cpp: rename readTDC to
	readMetaData, writeTDC to writeMetaData, and updateTDC to
	updateMetaData

2009-05-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixpack.cpp, src/ixpale.cpp, src/ixambit.cpp, src/zone.cpp:
	fix more bugs in function estimate (involving operator cobinations
	that can not be accessed through the query parser)

2009-05-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: fixing cases involving x < a >= x or x <= a > x in
	doScan and doCount; add code to unload indexes and retry the
	evaluateRange call
	* src/countQuery.cpp: minor clean up of log messages
	* src/range.cpp: a couple of bin1 should have been bin0 in
	range::locate, a couple hit1 should be hit0
	* src/icentre.cpp: in entre::estimate cand1+1 >= bounds.size()
	should have been cand1 >= bounds.size() (the error causes
	incorrect answers when the query boundary is in the next to the
	last bin)
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add code in doQuery to exercise the
	countQuery class
	* src/ixpack.cpp: fixing bugs in pack::estimate

2009-05-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: uncomment AC_FUNC_VPRINTF, otherwise the log
	functions logMessage, logWarning and logError are crippled
	* src/part.cpp:5996 change the constant expression so that rid1
	will never be resized to an empty array
	* examples.cpp: minor adjustment the function clean_up and print
	out
	* src/ibin.cpp, src/irange.cpp, src/imesa.cpp: in function
	construct set the values of offsets
	* src/column.cpp: in searchSortedICC and searchSortedOOCC, call
	round_up for some of the comparison operators

2009-05-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/i*.cpp: remove (or comment out) calls to function write from
	all versions of concrete implementations of ibis::index::append
	* src/part.cpp: in verifyBackupDir, set backupDir to nil (0) if
	makeDir fails
	* src/ibin.cpp: handle the case where the existing index is not of
	the currect size in ibis::bin::append, change all implementations
	of ibis::index::append to check for the value of nrows against
	nold
	* configure.ac, src/config.h.in: use extra AC_OUTPUT_COMMANDS to
	rename PACKAGE_VERSION and friends to FASTBIT_VERSION etc.  This
	is to avoid possible conflict with other packages with the default
	names (a problem reported by Prabhat)
	* src/ibis.h: move call to util::setLogFileName ahead of
	gParameters().read
	* src/const.h: add a backup definition for FASTBIT_STRING
	(otherwise cannot use FASTBIT_STRING without checking)
	* src/util.cpp: change the initial message print to a log file to
	include FastBit version and bug report information
	* src/ibin.cpp: add new function construct to consolidate the
	construction of a binned index
	* src/index.cpp: in index::create add more print statement in case
	of abnormal indexes

2009-05-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: rename buildIndex, loadIndex, and
	unloadIndex to buildIndexes, loadIndexes, and unloadIndexes
	* INSTALL, win/README: add notes about the new macro
	WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H
	* src/const.h, src/capi.h: don't include config.h under
	VisualStudio on Win32
	* src/part.cpp: in part::init, try to preserve the backupDir read
	from metadata file; in function doScan remove calls to
	foldBoundaries and foldUnsignedBoundaries before calling the
	template doScan; the case for rng.rightOperator() == OP_EQ  did
	not check that the rounded boundary actually equal to the original
	query boundary
	* configure.ac:325 need to define WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H when
	trying to compile wherelexer.cc
	* src/idirekte.cpp: implement direkte::append
	* src/ibin.cpp ...: in all concrete versions of
	ibis::index::write, add calls to fileManager::flushFile after
	failure to open the index file

2009-05-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp, src/irelic.cpp, src/idirekte.cpp: in estimateCost
	for qContinuousRange, take into account of the complement option
	* src/util.h:1072 in the round_up that outputs float, only invoke
	nextafter if the initial rounding produce a value that is less
	than the input value
	* src/idirekte.cpp: update function locate for all combinations
	that can be generated
	* src/qExpr.cpp: simplify qContinuousRange::print to more
	faithfully print the actually expression
	* src/qExpr.h: make leftBound and rightBound of qContinuousRange
	simply return lower and upper
	* src/capi.h, src/const.h, src/util.h: remove the macro
	HAVE_CONFIG_H, add WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H.  On systems that can
	not run the configure script, the user must define
	WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H (to address a problem reported by Hank
	Childs)

2009-05-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: correct template doScan and doCount (that makes
	use of std::binder1st and std::biner2nd) to make use of the new
	function round_up, simplify their comparisons by taking into
	account of conditions that might contain each other; change the
	answer to ill-formed range expressions to be 0; change
	part::selfTest to pick a random column for testRangeOperators
	instead of using the sorted one

2009-05-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: add templates ibis::util::round_down and
	ibis::util::round_up (with specializations)
	* configure.ac: add check for function nextafter, to be used in
	incrDouble, round_up and friends in util.h

2009-05-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: rename getRawData to
	getValuesArray

2009-04-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth2d.cpp, src/parth3d?.cpp: when getRawData fails try
	selectTypes again.  Because getRawData is not a virtual function,
	client code may not be able to access them correctly.  This cause
	problems in applications like HDF5_FastQuery (reported by Allen
	Sanderson)
	* src/part.h: make templated version of doScan static member
	functions to indicate they are not usable for inherening
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: rename existing templated
	selectValues to selectValuesT, add virtual function selectValues
	that uses void* to pass the values; change template getRawData to
	a virtual function with void* for the values.  These virtual
	functions are to be overwritten in derived classes to provide
	different ways of accessing the base data.

2009-04-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp:5750 further refine the cost estimation to taking
	into account of how many edge bins are needed for candidate check
	* src/ibin.cpp, src/irelic.cpp: clean up in-line documentation

2009-04-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp:5745 ibis::bin::estimateCost mistakenly compares
	cand1 against bits.size, more natural to use offsets.size();
	change the version of locate called to get a more accurate
	information about the query processing cost (a problem that was
	originally noticed by Prabhat and Allen Sanderson)

2009-04-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp:1624 delete the line that changes ierr to 0 and -1
	* src/tafel.cpp:1055 in function write, add code to check for
	index specification in gParameters
	* tests/Makefile.am: make test failure message more consistent,
	they now all starts with 'Did NOT pass' such-and-such test
	* examples/tcapi.c: add explicit casting to match the types
	specified in the print format (otherwise prints wront value for
	64-bit integers on Mac under gcc 4.0.0)

2009-04-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parti.cpp: prevent current versions of part::reorder from
	working on partitions with string values, they simply will not
	work.  Add code to deal with external RIDs if they are present.
	* INSTALL: add note (13) regarding the user of prefix and Java
	native interface
	* src/bundle.h, src/bundle.cpp: clean up in-line documentation,
	add getLong and getULong to ibis::query::result
	* src/whereClause.h, src/selectClause.h: clean up in-line
	documentation -- whereClause was not showing up in the doxygen
	documents
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add selectBytes, selectUBytes,
	selectShort, selectUShort, and selectULong
	* src/query.h, src/query.cpp: add getQualifiedBytes,
	getQualifiedUBytes, getQualifiedShorts, getQualifiedUShorts,
	getQualifiedLongs, and getQualifiedULongs
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.cpp: change tablex::appendRow to return
	the number of values added, change tablex::appendRows to return
	the number of rows added

2009-04-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.h, src/query.cpp: add function getQualifiedStrings
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add function selectStrings
	* src/utilidor.h: clean up errors in in-line documentation

2009-04-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: actually try to compile src/whereLexer.cc to
	determine whether to use win/FlexLexer.h or not

2009-04-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tab.h, src/bord.h, src/join.h, src/joinin.h:
	change the return value type from point to reference to reduce the
	need to check the validity of the pointers (existing code did not
	check them anyway)
	* src/bord.cpp, src/mensa.cpp: in getColumnAsString move statement
	copying oss.str() to individual cases, previously this was done at
	the end, which causes all string values to returned as empty string

2009-04-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp:670 need to multiply page size to
	pi.PhysicalTotal to get bytes
	* src/tafel.cpp, src/tafel.h: add masks to functions locate,
	locateString, append, and appendString -- to ensure the masks are
	extended as the values are added through ibis::table::row
	* src/mensa.cpp: change the behavior of ibis::mensa::addPartition
	to examine the global configuration entries when the input
	directory name is not a valid string

2009-04-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: change the handling of debug and xopt options to
	preserve the existing CXXFLAGS specified by the user.  change
	version number to 1.0.7
	* src/tafel:1207 move the line that clears col.mask into the
	if-block for nil pointers (in ibis::tafel::capacity).  Previously,
	the mask is cleared for no reason at all.

2009-04-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: in tafel::normalize add statement to make sure
	col.mask is of the correct size
	* src/tafel.h: remove const from the template tafel::append and
	function tafel::appendString, the const keyword is preventing the
	modified values being propergating back to the callers
	* src/qExpr.cpp:125 the right-hand side should be tm1 instead of
	tm2 (tm2 has been deleted in the previous line) -- a bug reported
	by Hank Childs and Prabhat
	* src/qExpr.cpp:755 change the output statement to check whether
	or not the output pointer is nil

2009-04-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bundle.cpp, src/part.cpp, src/parti.cpp, src/query.cpp;
	change the name of data file for the explicit RIDs from "rids" to
	"-rids".  Since no valid column name can start with a dash, this
	removes any possibility of name collision.
	* src/part.cpp, src/query.cpp: change getRIDs to output implicit
	RIDs if no explicit ones are available
	* src: add macro FASTBIT_SYNC_WRITE to control whether to make a
	fsync call before closing a file opened for write.  If it is
	defined and _POSIX_FSYNC is also defined, then fsync will be
	called
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.h, src/tafel.cpp: add function capacity
	to report the maximum number of rows that can be stored with the
	current memory allocated
	* src/array_t.h: add function capacity

2009-04-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:4784 change the message to more accurately reflect
	the fact ibis::part::buildIndex merely goes through each column,
	not necessarily builds any indexes
	* src/bitvector.cpp:3700 update the message printed from
	ibis::bitvector::reserve to indicate it is reserving the specified
	number of words not bytes
	* src/util.cpp:1272 add conditions to avoid copying the message
	string in an attempt to make the timer class light-wiehgt
	* src/column.cpp:8992 through some timing measurements on
	hutch.lbl.gov, decided on a new test for choosing between binary
	search and linear matching in ibis::column::searchSortedICD, add
	statement to reserve space for hits (but timing measurements do
	not show any advantage of doing it, keeping it anyway because it
	seem to make sense)

2009-04-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp:1714 need to multiply by sizeof(T) when
	recording the size of the buffer.  This error was causing the file
	manager to incorrectly counting the number of bytes in memory and
	causing the it to attempt to free memory that are not there.  Have
	confirmed with valgrind that there is actually no memory leak at
	this time.
	* src/util.h:58&65 Andrey Kolchanov report that on MacOS gcc 4
	does not yet support atomic operations.  In class util::counter,
	make use of macro HAVE_GCC_ATOMIC32 instead of relying on GCC
	version to avoid the problem reported by Andrey
	* src/util.cpp: re-enable printing of leading space in the
	constructor of ibis::util::logger class as indicated in the
	documentation of the function, remove extra parameters to most of
	the invocations of the constructor of logger

2009-04-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: add two more try-catch blocks to make a
	total of eight layers as promised in the documentation of the
	constructor if ibis::fileManager::buffer
	* src/qExpr.h: add constructor for ibis::qDiscreteRange to make
	use of array_t<double>

2009-04-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: in tafel::write reusing the variable olddesc
	causes incorrect description to be printed at the end

2009-04-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.h: add reserveSpace to ibis::tablex.
	* src/tafel.cpp: add LOGGER statements before all statements that
	returns a negative number

2009-04-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src, examples: address warnings raised by the gcc compiler
	* tests/Makefile.am: reorder the final output of appendTest0 from
	do-large-append (so the built-in tests will invoke the new
	functions on sorted data)
	* src/column.cpp: re-arrange code to recover from error
	searchSorted
	* src/column.h: make searchSorted virtual so that HDF5_FastQuery
	can redefine them

2009-04-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: change handling of --with-java option to only
	check for the javac if the JAVA directory (either specified
	through --with-java or environment variable JAVA_HOME) actually
	exists
	* tests/Makefile.am: add a test case in check-ibis to try the
	weighted histogram computations

2009-03-31 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.h, src/fileManager.cpp: add functions
	adjustCacheSize and currentCacheSize at the request of Jochen
	Schlosser, update in-line documentation of some functions
	* src/part.h: add weighted versions of get1DBins, get2DBins, and
	get3DBins
	* src/parth3dw.cpp: add separate file for an implementation of
	get3DBins with weighting
	* src/column.cpp: avoid ibis::roster if currentDataDir() returns
	nil, a problem encountered in HDF5_FastQuery reported by Oliver
	Ruebel
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add a new print weighted command to test the
	new weighted histogram functions, add calls to ibis::util::clean
	to free vector<bitvector*> allocated with get1DBins, get2DBins,
	and get3DBins.
	* src/parth.cpp: get1DDistribution returns the number of rows
	selected instead of the number of bins

2009-03-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h: start implementing functions to compute weighted
	histograms at the request of Oliver Ruebel

2009-03-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h: update the binary search procedure in
	qDiscreteRange::inRange to check the last values[m]
	* examples/ibis.cpp: in findMissingValues, count the values that
	match and report if query 1 found less instances than query 0,
	print all values if more than half will be printed
	* tests/Makefile.am: add a new test case to exercise the new test
	implemented in tableSelect of examples/ibis.cpp (with option -r)

2009-03-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: in the loop to handle reordering of data
	partitions, delete str at the end (instead of in the middle)
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: change m_desc from char* to
	std::string
	* src/parti.cpp: add note to m_desc to indicate the data has been
	reordered, add call to computeMinMax if the min/max are not set
	when deciding whether to use the column as a key for sorting (in
	ibis::part::reorder)
	* src/column.h, src/part.h: add call to strerror to explain errors
	from pthread functions
	* src/query.cpp:660 avoid print extremely long query expressions
	* src/column.cpp, src/part.cpp: change the print out of the column
	name only (no the list of values, which can be awfully long)
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add code to chech the values returned by qq0
	and qq1 in tableSelect (function findMissingValues and
	findMissingValuesT actually does the work)

2009-03-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: reduce the threshold for invoking default
	maxBytes computation to MIN_DOMAP_SIZE from 10 MB, to allow for
	maxBytes to be very small so that we can test the out-of-core
	functions in column.cpp
	* src/fileManager.cpp: change the constructor of
	ibis::fileManager::buffer to check the amount of free memory
	before allocating anything, make sure no more than 1/4th of the
	free memory is given to a new buffer
	* src/column.cpp:5276 add statement to indicate the data is no
	longer sorted after an append operation

2009-03-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

	takes an ibis::qExpr object, add code to delete hits and cand after
	modifying the query expression or data partition
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add function part::testRangeOperators
	* src/ibin.cpp, src/irelic.cpp: set return values to indicate an
	empty range in case of an ill-formed range expression
	* src/qExpr.h: add virtual function nItems to ibis::qExpr to count
	the number of items in a query expression tree
	* examples/ibis.cpp: expand the handling of reordering option to
	allow column names to be specified after a directory name
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: add function find_upper to find
	the upper bound (as in STL function upper_bound), the existing
	function find is similar to STL function lower_bound

2009-03-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: add function getColumnAsDoubles that returns the
	values in std::vector<double>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add code in tableSelect to directly generate
	ibis::qDiscreteRange query expression (reuse the verify_rid flag
	-r)
	* src/column.h: add protected member m_sorted (default false)

2009-03-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: change all calls to util::logMessage to
	LOGGER to avoid casting the integers

2009-03-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

	ibis::tafel::readCSV

2009-03-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

	* win/Win.mak, win/MinGW.mak: include the new file countQuery.cpp

2009-03-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>

	be tmp->termType()
	* src/qExpr.cpp: change compRange::print to avoid print unknown
	operators
	* src/qExpr.h: ibis::compRange::inRange() neglected to check for
	nil pointers
	* src/qExpr.cpp: ibis::bediener::reduce mishandles a number of
	different cases, ibis::stdFunction1::reduce neglect to set ret to
	nil where it should have set it to this

	ibis::countQuery
	* src/mensa.cpp: change all references to ibis::query to
	ibis::countQuery

2009-02-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: add codes to evaluateRange to answer
	qDiscreteRange queries with sorted list of data if they are
	present
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add option '-sort column-name' to allow the
	user to sort selected columns of a data partition

	queryTest or quickTest (both of which may invoke doScan
	which are not available on string valued columns)
	* src/part.cpp: recursiveQuery checks against nEvents, but should
	have used the number of ones in the column mask
	* src/part.h: getMask --> getNullMask, to be consistent with the
	function names elsewhere

2009-02-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/iroster.h, src/iroster.cpp: reorganize ibis::roster

2009-02-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h, src/fileManager.h, etc: move util::buffer to
	fileManager::buffer and add code to track to its memory usage

2009-02-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.h, src/tafel.cpp, examples/ardea.cpp: add
	an optional argument to readCSV for user to specify the maximum
	number of rows expected from the input file, add user to specify
	the maximum number of rows on the command line of ardea (a
	suggestion from Norbert Heusser <heusser at online.de>)
	* src/category.cpp: add a buffer to store starting positions in
	text::startPosition to reduce the numbre of calls to fwrite
	* src/mensa.cpp: the constructor is cursor may divide by zero is
	the table contains only string-valued data, in this case, assume
	each value takes no more than 1024 bytes
	* src/category.cpp: add a buffer to store the starting positions
	in text::search to reduce the number of read operations, unroll
	the loop for matching strings, make the comparisons
	case-insensitive

2009-02-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* configure.ac: added space surrounding expression of the form
	"test a=b"
	* src/tafel.cpp: variable cnt needs to be set to zero for every
	line of input text in ibis::tafel::readCSV, change all default
	delimiter string from ", " to ","
	* src/util.cpp: add special cases in ibis::util::getString
	(3-argument version) to avoid calls to strchr

2009-02-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp: use an integer array to sort the incoming values
	instead of a std::set (at the suggestion of Alesandro Capucci)
	* examples/ibis.cpp, doc/ibisCommandLine.html: change the print
	out to indicate that tableSelect is producing another table as
	output and the "count(*)" will produce a table of one row and one
	column, update the documentation about the ibis command line to
	reflect this fact (not a new feature but a clarification of
	behavior)
	* src/category.cpp: the computation to carry the leftover bytes in
	function startPositions had an extra accumulation of offset, a
	problem first reported by Andrey Kolchanov

2009-02-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: add calls to unload in mapFile and doRead
	after they fail for the first time (to address a problem reported
	by Alessandro Capucci)
	* tests/Makefile.am: remove - from test 3 of check-tcapi, the sh
	on a BSD machine does not like it

2009-02-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add indications of total number of hits in
	addition to how many are printed in function tableSelect (to
	address a problem encountered by Alessandro Capucci)
	* configure.ac: if --enable-xopt is specified by nothing is
	specified for debug, use -O3, which is more widely supported than
	-O5

2009-02-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp, src/category.cpp: updated documentations while
	looking for clues to the problem reported by Alessandro Capucci
	<alessandro at totalwire.it>

2009-02-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h: move two inlined functions ibis::table::groupby and
	ibis::table::orderby to mensa.cpp to make the header file more
	self contained.  Those two function requires
	ibis::table::parseNames, which is already in mensa.cpp, change
	parseNames to be class function
	* src/whereLexer.ll: change a number sequence to require at least
	three numbers, change {WS}* after the first string in the
	definition of string sequence to be {SEP}+ -- to address a problem
	reported by David Marks <marksdb at cox.net>
	* src/whereParser.yy: add special cases for IN predicate with one-
	and two-number sequences on the right-hand side
	* tests/Makefile.am, win/MinGW.mak: change case 2 of check-ibis to
	test for a simplified version of problem reported to cause problem
	for David Mark
	* src/qExpr.cpp: in math::stdFunction1::reduce, add special case
	to absorb pairs of consecutive log and exp functions

2009-02-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth3d.cpp: add macro FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES to control
	whether the BYTE, UBYTE, SHORT, USHORT and ULONG are handled
	separately with different template instances.  If
	FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES is defined, all ten fixed-size column
	types are expanded to have their own instances of the template
	functions.  However, with three levels of expansion, it creates
	thousands of instances of the template function and takes a very
	long time to compile.  If the macro is not defined, the default
	behavior, only five template instances are created at each level.
	Overall, this should reduce the number of template instances by a
	factor eight.  Should improve the compile time without sacrifice
	too much run-time performance.
	* src/parth3da.cpp, src/parth3db.cpp: split the two get3DBins
	functions from src/parth3d.cpp to reduce compilation time
	* tests/Makefile.am: remove 2>&1, it somehow cause errors on
	cygwin during 'make check'
	* configure.ac: move the block for handling --enable-debug and
	--enable-xopt to the beginning of the custome code in configure.ac
	to set the initial value of CFLAGS, let the default CFLAGS pass
	through when neither debug nor xopt is set

2009-02-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/Makefile.am: add check-tcapi test 3 to confirm the output
	from text::selectLongs, add tcapi-3 to the list dist_data_DATA

2009-01-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/capi.cpp:632 add ibis::TEXT and ibis::CATEGORY as acceptable
	column types for fastbit_get_qualified_longs (bug found by Andrey
	Kolchanov)
	* java/milky.java, examples/tcapi.c: add a case for retrieving
	values as 64-bit integers
	* configure.ac: change the code used for testing atomic function,
	change how the CFLAGS is carried through the configure script

2009-01-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.h: add the 4th argument to index::create to determine
	whether to load an index in its entirety, previously, this option
	is available through a undocumented global variable (a feature
	requested by Jochen Schlosser)
	* src/column.h, src/part.h: add the 2nd argument to the function
	loadIndex to make use of the new argument in ibis::index::create
	* src/resource.h: update documentation to a couple of functions
	* doc/index.html, doc/rara.html: refer to the new html file
	rara.html in index.html, change < and > to &lt; and &gt; in
	rara.html

2009-01-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/FastBit.java: update internal documentation about the
	functions.
	* src/util.h: add checks on WINVER to avoid invokding 64-bit
	atomic functions on non-64-bit machines under windows (in
	ibis::util::sharedInt64)
	* src/mensa.h, mensa.cpp: change curPart to be an integer
	* src/util.h, src/mensa.cpp, src/capi.cpp, src/part.cpp,
	src/query.cpp: change ibis::partList into a std::vector, rename
	the old associative array into partAssoc -- only use it within the
	scope of individual functions.  A unsuccessfull attempt to figure
	out why win/trydll.cpp fails to clean up the variable tlist --
	probably the same old problem with dll export.

2009-01-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/rara.cpp: add a small test program named after the smallest
	ibis
	* doc/rara.html: add annotation for the small example rara.cpp
	* src/util.h: remove const qualifier from the return type of
	operator() for sharedInt32 and sharedInt64, change the definition
	of HAVE_GCC_ATOMIC[32|64] to trust the definition from config.h

2009-01-21 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win/trydll.cpp: update the call to constructor of
	util::quietLock and util::counter to the new argument lists
	* src/index.cpp: restore the use of ibis::relic when the index
	specification is "relic" -- existing code attempts to use
	ibis::direkte in some cases when "relic" is requested
	* src/irelic.cpp: in ibis::relic::read check for valid type codes
	explicitly
	* src/ibis.h: add conditional code to increase the verbose level
	if DEBUG or _DEBUG is defined
	* java/README.txt: update instructions related to the new package
	name gov.lbl.fastbit

2009-01-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: use the new macros defined in src/config.h
	(HAVE_GCC_ATOMIC32 and HAVE_GCC_ATOMIC64) for help
	determining the presence of atomic operations
	* src/column.h: change member variable idxcnt from uint32_t to
	ibis::util::sharedInt32 to provide more consistent tracking of
	index usage
	* src/part.h: add get1DBins and get2DBins that return
	std::vector<ibis::bitvector*> based on the experience of Oliver
	who observed that using the null pointers instead of allocating
	empty bitmaps can reduce the execution of his program by about
	half.  Note that Oliver was using get3DBins which is much more
	likely to produce empty bins than get2DBins and get1DBins,
	therefore the benefit of returning null pointers might be less.

2009-01-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: update the messages printed out from
	fileManager::getFile that actually does the reading, to enable the
	printing of the address of the allocated memory
	* src/util.h: add conditions to prevent the use of
	__sync_add_and_fetch and friends on 8-byte integers under GCC
	4.1.x (need to find a better way to detect when to use this GCC
	extension)
	* configure.ac: add two sections to figure out whether
	__sync_add_and_fetch is supported, regenerate src/config.h.in with
	autoheader

2009-01-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.h, src/category.cpp: add ibis::text::selectLongs to
	extract the starting positions of the selected strings (so that
	the caller may read the string values directly, a hack for Andrey
	Kolchanov)
	* src/fileManager.cpp: simplify the print logic in
	storage::enlarge, ensure all memory allocations are recorded

2009-01-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: change ibis::util::counter to use GCC atomic
	extension as well
	* src/util.h: remove the unused member variable mesg from
	ibis::util::counter, add code to use interlocked variables in
	ibis::util::counter
	* src/util.h: change sharedInt template to two versions for
	uint32_t and uint64_t to take advantage of atomic functions
	available on windows under visual studio 9
	* src/fileManger.h, src/fileManager.cpp: remove countMutex,
	change totalBytes to be ibis::util::sharedInt64, change
	storage::nref from unsigned to ibis::util::sharedInt32
	* win/MinGW.mak: add case 10 to check-ibis

2009-01-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: add ibis::util::sharedInt template to make use of
	GCC extension for atomic operations on integers

2009-01-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/resource.h: separate the default constructor from the
	constructor that takes a string argument based on a suggestion
	from Niklas Bulitta.  Note that the function ibis::gParameter()
	only uses the default constructor.  Update the documentation of
	the functions in ibis::resource.
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test case 10 to check-ibis to exercise
	the new built-in tests for multi-threaded query evaluations

2009-01-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h: start to implement a set of function that use a
	thread pool to answer different queries --
	ibis::part::buildQueryList and ibis::part::checkQueryList
	* src/part.cpp: rename ibis_part_startTests to
	ibis_part_threadedTestFun1, add ibis_part_threadedTestFun2 to
	process the list of queries generated by buildQueryList

2009-01-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* java/FastBit.java: change package name to be gov.lbl.fastbit,
	add FastBitJNI group to doxygen documentation
	* src/Doxyfile: add java/FastBit.java and the example files in
	examples to the list of source files
	* src/query.cpp:6584 add OPEN_FILEMODE as the 3rd argument to
	UnixOpen function call (an error spotted by Niklas Bulitta)
	* src/query.cpp:1712 add local static variable myhostid to cache
	the host ID instead of making the system call every time
	(suggested by Niklas Bulitta)
	* src/parth3d.cpp: add a variantion of get3DBins that returns
	bitmaps in container std::vector<ibis::bitvector*>.  Based on the
	timing measurements from Oliver, keeping empty bitmaps as nil
	pointers might be able to reduce the memory usage reduce overall
	execution time of get3DBins, especially if the majority of the
	bins are empty.
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add code in print3DDistributiion to test the
	new get3DBins that returns std::vector<ibis::bitvector*>

2009-01-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win/MinGW.mak: add check-ibis
	* java/FastBit.java, java/FastBit.c: following a suggestion from
	Andrey Kolchanov <kolchanov at gmail.com> and placed JNI code in a
	package named gov.lbl.sdm

2009-01-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win/MinGW.mak, win/Win.mak: update these make files for the two
	new source files
	* win/*.vcproj: include parth2d.cpp and parth3d.cpp in the
	VisualStudio project files

2009-01-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth2d.cpp, src/parth3d.cpp, src/parth.pp: split parth.cpp
	into three file to reduce the time needed for compilation
	* src, examples: change copyright year to include 2009

2009-01-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h, src/util.cpp: add ibis::util::compactValue2 to
	compute the most compact binary value in a given range
	* examples/ibis.cpp: compute stride values in print2DDistribution
	and print3DDistribution using compact binary values to make the
	arithmetic computation less affected by rounding.  This is mostly
	to avoid visual mismatches, for example, the value 0.1 printed on
	screen is actually slightly larger than the precise value of 0.1
	inside the computer.  Given begin=0 and stride=0.1, one may expect
	the value 1.0 to be in bin 10, but it actually ends up in bin 9.
	The apparent unexpected placement of values can be to diagnose.

2009-01-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/array_t.cpp: in constructors assign m_begin to 0 in the
	initialization lists, assign values to m_begin in the constructor
	body after checking the values of actual
	* src/bitvector.cpp:393 add call to m_vec.nosharing() to
	ibis::bitvector::setBit (when a std::vector<ibis::bitvector> is
	resized, it creates multiple copies of a dummy bitvector)
	* src/parth.cpp: line 3011, vals2 should have been vals3, lines
	2987 and 2974, end2 should have been end3!
	* src/bitvector.cpp: count bitmaps as in decompressed state only
	if the m_vec contain some (> 0) bits -- this avoids the invocation
	of functions xx_c0 that assume the raw pointers can be used
	directly (in case of an empty m_vec, the raw pointer can not be
	used because it might be nil)
	* win/ibis.vcproj: add . to the include directories for the
	Release build

2008-12-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: rename the existing print2DDistribution and
	print3DDistribution with ones that uses (begin, end, stride) to
	specify fixed bins -- to exercise the new get2DBins and get3DBins

2008-12-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.cpp:4093 add statement to delete tmp, add call to
	compress and copy the resulting bit vector which typically reduces
	the memory usage
	* src/bitvector.cpp:4116 reorganize the triple-nested loop to
	reduce the number of temporary variables generated, add call to
	compress, and copy the result to reduce memory footprint held by
	the result bit vectors
	* src/parth.cpp in adaptiveIntsDetailed and adaptiveFloatsDetailed
	add function calls to compress the bit vectors generated from
	sumBits

2008-12-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h: add get1DBins, get2DBins and get3DBins that takes
	(begin, end, stride) triples to define exact bin boundaries (a
	feature requested by Prabhat and Oliver Ruebel)

2008-12-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.h, src/mensa.cpp, src/bord.cpp: add function dumpNames
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add outputnamestoo to capture the request to
	also output the column names in the output file
	* doc/ibisCommandLine.html: update the description of option
	-output to indicate the new variant -output-with-header
	* tests/Makefile.am: capitalize the word NOT to make failure
	messages stand out a little bit more
	* src/selectClause.h:72 add (required) return statement

2008-12-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tab.h, src/bord.h: add function dumpNames to
	print a one-line header for CSV output

2008-12-9 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuge.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp: the function
	coarsen contains an incorrect test, the condition (ncoarse < 5 ||
	ncoarse <= nobs) should be (ncoarse < 5 || ncoarse >= nobs)
	* src: minor tinkering with the print-out (while debugging an
	application)

2008-12-4 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win/Win.mak, win/MinGW.mak: update makefiles for Visual Studio's
	nmake and GNU make under MinGW/MinSYS
	* src/util.cpp: add conditional comiplation macro for MinGW32 in
	ibis::util::userName()

2008-12-1 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* README, win/README, tests/README: update the instructions
	following an inquiry from a new user

2008-11-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/category.cpp:201 incremented it by (newentry-1) instead of
	newentry
	* tests/readcsv.cpp: change header files to satisfy g++-4 under
	cygwin

2008-11-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp:3850 make the lower bound larger to create more
	bins for larger values in log-scale -- this affects the case of
	indexing integer values as floating-point values and the minimum
	value is exactly 0, in which case the majority of the bin
	boundaries are less than 1 and useless
	* src/column.cpp:4696 add a statement in evaluateRange to clear
	the existing content of result variable (low), later statements
	depend on the size of this variable to determine what to do
	* configure.ac: update to autoconf 2.63
	* src/fileManager.cpp: in function unload, clean up the usage of
	variable sum, simplify the logic for determining what objects to
	remove.  The previous usage of sum is incorrect in the loop
	to free candiates.
	* src/fileManager.cpp: add call to sysctl on BSD flavored machines
	to find out the physical memory size
	* tests: completed more-check successfully on portnoy (FreeBSD),
	davinci(linux), data2 (linux), starsky(Darwin), and bit (cygwin)

2008-11-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth.cpp:3091 change "i > 1" to "i > 0" in
	ibis::part::get1DDistribution to fix an error in histogram
	computation found by Niklas Bulitta
	* src/parth.cpp:3102 change test to produce a tighter upper bound
	for the last bin boundary
	* src/part.cpp: add write lock to computeMinMax and buildIndex
	* examples/ibis.cpp:679 change ibis::gVerbose > 0 to
	ibis::gVerbose >= 0, to print selected values without requiring -v
	option
	* src/ifade.cpp, src/isapid.cpp, src/isbiad.cpp, src/islice.cpp:
	add cases to handle 6 more different types of integer values --
	fixes an error observed by Niklas Bulitta
	* tests/scripts/matchCounts.pl:45 change fgrep to egrep to catch
	a larger variety of error messages
	* tests/scripts/matchCounts.pl:38 convert all non-alphanumeric
	characters in query condition to underscore so that the backup
	file names may be acceptable on windows (under cygwin)
	* src/utilidor.cpp:1281 add definition for nelm (used in DEBUG
	code)
	* src/part.cpp:4535 removed invalid DEBUG code
	* src/whereLexer.ll:129 change STRSEQ to contain at least three
	strings (to avoid trouble with one- and two-argument functions),
	this also means that the string form of the 'IN' operator must
	have at least three strings on the right-hand side

2008-11-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ardea.cpp:696 separate out the default branch in
	parseNamesTypes to print a warning message (suggested by Niklas
	Bulitta)

2008-11-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp:1666 change == to !=, write output file if it
	is NOT /dev/null
	* tests/Makefile.am:57,59,61 modify tests to accommodate the new
	output format used by ibis.cpp (output from function tableSelect)

2008-11-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add calls to get2DBins and get3DBins in
	print2DDistribution and print3DDistribution as sanity check for
	these functions, add call to get1DBins in printColumn (Caution:
	due the different number of internal bins used, the function that
	retrieve the counts only, getxDDistributions, may not
	produce exactly the same output as those compute the bit vectors,
	getxDBins)
	* src/mensa.h: add default constructor to ibis::mensa
	* example/ibis.cpp: add function tableSelect to process queries
	using the select function of ibis::table interface (which can
	handle arithmetic expressions in the select clauses and combines
	answers from different data partitions)

2008-11-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h, src/parth.cpp: add get1DBins, get2DBins, and
	get3DBins and supporting functions

2008-11-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/parth.cpp: move histogram functions from part.cpp to
	parth.cpp
	* src/index.h: swap two pairs of names, addBins and addBits,
	sumBins and sumBits in ibis::index; move functions addBits and
	sumBits into public scope
	* src/part.h, src/parth.cpp: add adaptiveIntsDetailed and
	adaptiveFloatsDetailed, change all adaptive binning templates to
	return long
	* src/util.h, src/bitvector.cpp: add two versions of function
	ibis::util::intersect, rename ibis::outProduct to be
	ibis::util::outerProduct

2008-11-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: add an element of 0 to bnds[123] to simplify the
	loops in ibis::part::adaptive3DBins, delete val2 in
	get2DDistribution, round up bin boundaries for integers in
	get2DDistribution and get3DDistribution, fix errors in
	get3DDistribution, make sure the bin boundaries does not round
	down to values that are included in the bin to its left (this
	could happen because the bin numbers are computed using the
	differences which could be smaller, when these differences are
	added back, the rounding may lead to smaller bin boundaries)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test case check-ibis 9 to try out the 3D
	histogramming function

2008-11-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add statements to print out the return code
	in three functions that computes joint distributions
	* win: change the version numbers in the VisualStudio project
	files lower so it can work with the 2003 version
	* examples/ibis.cpp:505 missing col3 in the calling sequence of
	get3DDistribution

2008-11-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp:482 add print3DDistribution to exercise new
	functions in ibis::part
	* src/part.cpp:12186&12195 add statements to initialize counts
	array

2008-10-31 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp:2637 add check for the content of indexing
	option before changing the existing indexing option.  When the
	user supplied indexing option is different from what is in the
	data partition, remove the existing index files so that a fresh
	set of indexes are built.
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add adpative binning version of
	get3DDistribution

2008-10-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp: add statement to skip extra spaces and delimiters
	in ibis::table::parseNames
	* src/mensa.cpp: implement ibis::mensa::doSelect
	* src/part.cpp:16043 change ibis::part::barrel::read to use 8
	fixed-size integers instead of just "int" and "unsigned int"
	* src/qExpr.cpp:31 operator_name array missed "%" (for remainder)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add two test case under check-thula to

	FlexLexer.h

2008-10-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src: move ibis::query::verifyPredicate to
	ibis::whereClause::verify, move ibis::query::addJoinConstraints to
	ibis::whereClause::amplify

2008-09-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src: start using a new set of query parser for where clause: add
	whereClause.cpp, whereLexer.h; rename predicate.h -->
	whereClause.h, predicate.l --> whereLexer.ll predicate.y -->
	whereParser.yy, predicate.yy.cpp --> whereLexer.cc predicate.tab.h
	--> whereParser.hh, predicate.tab.cpp --> whereParser.cc

2008-09-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h, src/qExpr.cpp: move ibis::compRange::term and
	derived classes out of ibis::compRange and into ibis::math, change
	ibis::compRange::barrel to be ibis::math::barrel.

2008-09-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h, src/qExpr.cpp: add a new constructor of qAnyAny
	that takes a double value as the second argument, add proper
	prototype for operator<< that takes ibis::qExpr on the right-hand

	sequence of strings in the constructor of qMultiString

2008-09-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tab.h, src/bord.h, src/mensa.h: add an optional
	argument to ibis::table::dump that prints the first few rows of a
	table at the suggestion of David Kantowitz.

2008-09-22 David Kantowitz <dkantowitz at thinktradellc.com>

	ibis::bord::column

2008-09-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h, src/util.cpp, src/utilidor.h, src/utlidor.cpp: move
	the sorting function related to RIDSets to utilidor.h/cpp to limit
	the dependencies of util.h

2008-09-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp:2275 add check to make sure the column type is not
	text or category, an error spotted by David Kantowitz <dkantowitz
	at thinktradellc dot com>
	* src/mensa.cpp:2504&2516 buffer[j].cval used as a pointer to
	std::vector<std::string>, but should be a pointer to ibis::column
	(more specifically ibis::text or ibis::category)

2008-09-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:11365 check whether the empty bins exist before
	adding new bin boundaries
	* win/*.vcproj: change _USRDLL to CXX_USE_DLL

2008-09-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* win: Update visual studio project files for the new Visual
	Studio 2008

2008-08-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: in adaptive2DBins, change the upper bound on the
	number of bins from 1000 to 2048 to tests used by Prabhat to run
	without surprises.  If a user asks for more than 2048 bins in each
	dimension, they will be reduced to limit the memory required for
	computing the fine bins
	* tests/Makefile.am: update test functions to exercise
	two-dimensional histogram functions, update expected output

2008-08-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: change ibis::part::adaptiveBins into two functions
	adaptiveInts and adaptiveFloats
	* src/part.cpp: implement two new get2DDistribution for computing
	2D histograms (both conditional and unconditional) based on the
	template function adaptive2DBins.  The new implementation avoids
	the binary look up used in the previous implementation.

2008-08-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: add get1DDistribution to compute conditional
	histograms with adaptive bins (supported with template function
	ibis::part::adaptiveBins)

2008-08-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: mark the functions that returns bins with open
	ends as deprecated

2008-08-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp: cursor::dumpSome performed extra call to
	fillBuffers
	* doc/index.html, doc/dataLoading.html: add references to sample
	data

2008-08-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h and friends: add function dump that only print the
	first few rows (to allow ardea.cpp to only print a few rows
	without reading all rows into memory)
	* src/mensa.h, src/mensa.cpp: change ibis::mensa::cursor to read a
	small number of rows into memory at a time (instead of always read
	a whole partition into memory as a time)
	* src/utilidor.cpp:1103 disable global optimization for
	ibis::util::sortStrings_partition when using MS VisualStudio

2008-08-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ardea.cpp:788 change "> 0" to "== 0" (intended to
	print only small tables, but existing condition got it wrong)

2008-08-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/utilidor.cpp:5 include typeinfo (NOTE: gcc 3.3.3 complains
	about the explicit instantiation of the function templates
	ibis::util::sortKeys)

2008-08-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp:2123 correct the loop that eliminates duplicate
	values (an error first encountered by Prabhat)
	* src: add doxygen groups FastBitIBIS, FastBitMain, and FastBitCAPI

2008-08-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: clean up the in-line documentation about various
	functions related to the computation of histograms.
	* src/part.cpp: change get2DDistributionD to get2DDistributionU
	* src/part.cpp: add get2DDistributionA and adapative2DBins to
	implement adapative binning with base data for get2DDistribution
	(without any condition)

2008-07-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/const.h:211-251 change the conditional compilation to more
	precisely manage the definitions of exact-width integer types --
	addressing a compatibility issue with VisIt encountered by Gunther
	Weber

2008-07-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src, examples: remove some unused variables and functions

2008-07-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ifase.cpp, src/isapid.cpp, src/isbiad.cpp, src/islice.cpp:
	add a local block to limit the scope of variable hst (histogram)
	to take advantage of the automatical deallocation.  Jochen has
	report a small memory leak in ibis::fade::construct2, which could
	be related to this

2008-07-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/mensa.cpp, src/bord.h: change precisions of ASCII
	representation of floats and doubles to 8 and 18 respectively
	(default is 6)
	* examples/ardea.cpp, examples/thula.cpp: change the output
	precisions of floats and doubles to match src/mensa.cpp
	* examples/ardea.cpp: change it to write data after reading each
	CSV file

2008-06-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/thula.cpp: add option -x for exporting content of tables

2008-06-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* utilidor.cpp: add ibis::util::sort_heap to implement heap sort
	as the backup function for sort_quick (quick sort function), most
	the prototype information for most of the helper function for
	sorting into utilidor.cpp to hide them from the user

2008-06-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* array_t.h, array_t.cpp: add hsort (heap sort) and change qsort
	to make use of hsort at deep recursion level, set the maximum
	recursion depth to 20 in qsort
	* column.cpp:4674 add call to check the cost of using an index
	before actually use it

2008-06-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* utilidor.h, utilido.cpp, join.h, joinin.h, joinin.cpp: add files
	that performs radix sort and in-memory equi-join from the branch
	ibis-branch-080429
	* src/Makefile.am:5 change versioninfo to version-info
	* tests/Makefile.am:44 change option -j to -y to match with the
	new ibis.cpp
	* src/ixfuge.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, and src/ixbylt.cpp: add code to
	ensure the number of coarse bins is not more than the number of
	distinct values (bins)
	* Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am: change quick-check to check, and
	check to more-check, so the default check does a minimal amount of
	testing as not to surprise the user with the excessive long run
	time on some platfoms

2008-06-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: lines 1341 and 1342 are swapped (a bug reported by
	Xufei Qian of SDSC)

2008-06-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.cpp: change ibis::query::evaluate and
	ibis::query::computeHits to accept empty where clause when the
	select clause is specified
	* example/ibis.cpp: accept query string without a where clause if
	it has a select clause (request from Ross Bates)

2008-05-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/colValues.h: add function nosharing to ibis::colValues.
	This addresses a problem reported by Ross Bates.  When all records
	are selected, the previous code attempts to sort an array that was
	based on a read-only memory map.
	* src/bundle.cpp: add calls to ibis::colValues::nosharing before
	sorting the bundles

2008-05-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.cpp:882: add the case of using getpwuid back to
	function ibis::util::userName.  Ross Bates just pointed out that
	the function getlogin requires an actual login session (as
	indicated by the presence of a utmp entry or a TTY).  The function
	getlogin fails with a segfault if it is not able to determine the
	TTY or utmp entry.

2008-05-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibbylt.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, src/ixfuge.cpp: change the
	default value computation for ncoarse to use the one with smaller
	objective function value (rather than rounding the analytical
	expression).  This produces a more stable default value especially
	when the number of coarse bins is small.

2008-05-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuge.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp: change the
	default number of coarse bins (ncoarse) to make use of the coarse
	level index size, previous default values assume uniform random
	data, the new default values only assume the coarse level will be
	uncompressible, which is more general
	* tests/Makefile.am: change quick-chek to make sure the TESTDIR is
	cleared first, change the word 'failed' to 'did not pass' to make
	the message longer and stand out more

2008-05-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ixbylt.cpp: add code to read option ncoarse in index
	specification, change default ncoarse to 31 based on the
	heuristics of neutral space-time trade-off
	* src/ixfuge.cpp:715, src/ixfuzz.cpp:135, change default ncoarse
	to 44 based on the heuristics of neutral space-time trade-off
	* src/ixpack.cpp: change the default number of coarse bins to 31

2008-04-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/joinin.cpp: complete initial implementation of ibis::joinIN
	* examples/ibis.cpp: change the operation delete row to use -yank,
	add -join to test the class ibis::joinIN
	* src/Makefile.am: add entries for the new files, utilidor.cpp,
	joinin.cpp, utilidor.h, joinin.h and join.h

2008-04-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/utilidor.h, src/utilidor.cpp: separate the sorting functions
	in namespace ibis::util from joinin.cpp and array_t.cpp.  Timing
	measurements show that the radix sort is the most efficient if
	there are more than a few thousand elements in the array to be
	sorted.  Change ibis::util::sort to ibis::util::sortall because it
	sorts all arrays passed to it.  Rename the newer sorting function
	to be ibis::util::sortkeys because they only sort according to the
	arrays keys.
	* *: create new tag on trunk (ibis-base-080429) and a new branch
	ibis-branch-080429, discard the branch b093pre-addjoin
	* src/utilidor.cpp: implement ibis::util::sortMerge
	* src/joinin.cpp: implement ibis::joinIN::evaluate

2008-04-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/joinin.cpp: add radix sort functions

2008-04-28 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp:2240 add code to match the SQL patterns in
	data partition names (a feature that was promised in
	ibisCommandLine.html but was lost somehow)
	* src/query.cpp: add function ibis::util::nameList::add
	* src/mensa.h: add function select2
	* src/util.cpp: change ibis::util::strMatch to be case insensitive
	* examples/thula.cpp: add option -f requested by Jon Strabala

2008-04-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h: change ibis::util::tablesFrom??? to return the
	number of new partition they create

	* tests/Makefile.am: add test case 3 to check-text to exercise the
	operator IN

2008-04-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.cpp: replace calls to append individual bits with
	appendFill in function erase
	* src/util.cpp: change conditional compilation instruction for
	using getlogin_r in userName
	* src/bitvector.cpp:2129 remove extra conditions in the if statement
	* src/bitvector.h: in copy_runs and copy_runsn, change the code to
	not use it.nWords in cases where it.isFill is not true
	* src/bitvector64.h: change copy_runs and copy_runsn to no use
	it.nWords when it.isFill is 0
	* src/ifade.cpp, src/irelic.cpp, src/isapid.cpp, src/isbiad.cpp,
	src/islice.cpp: locate(vals[i]) should be locate(varr[i]) in
	functions that process ibis::qDiscreteRange (an error first
	reported by Prabhat)

2008-04-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.h: add function empty

2008-04-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/irelic.cpp: update a number of implementation if
	read(ibis::fileManager::storage*) to remove the statements that
	deletes str -- this should not have been done

2008-04-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/table.h, src/tafel.h, src/tafel.cpp: add function clearData
	* src/qExpr.cpp:2111 add check to see if the array is sorted
	before calling the sorting function

2008-04-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.cpp:3358 need to resize bdry before assignments
	* src/qExpr.cpp:1367 check expr->left and expr->right

2008-04-01 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.cpp: change userName to use getlogin_r as the primary
	method
	* src/category.cpp: change the starting positions of strings from
	type long to type int64_t, make it possible to remove explicit
	instantiation of array_t<long>, which may conflict with other
	explicit instantiations

2008-03-31 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/fileManager.cpp: add new lines between some consecutive
	printing statements
	* examples/ibis.cpp: treat multiple printing options specified on
	command line independently, previously they are combined into one
	operation
	* src/part.cpp: in get2DDistributionD, refine the computation of
	stride1 and stride2 for integer values

2008-03-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.cpp:3700 add test to ensure avg is not assigned 0
	becasuse it is used in divisions later
	* src/util.cpp:973 change && to || in the conditions

2008-03-26 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.h: add keyword virtual to ibis::column::getActual???
	to allow FastQuery to override them
	* src/part.cpp: add setprecision(18) to the queries conditions
	genereated by various getxDDistribution functions.  A problem
	first observed by Prabhat.
	* src/index.cpp: change decisions to use the priority queue to
	put the number of bitmaps through the function square instead of
	log.  This improves the performance in a project with Prabhat.

2008-03-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h: add ibis::util::timer class to print out timing
	information in a fixed format, try the first case in
	ibis::bin::binOrderT
	* src/Doxyfile:1008 add FASTBIT_CXX_DLLSPEC to PREDEFINED, change
	EXTRACT_ALL back to NO

	* src/qExpr.cpp: add more cases to ibis::qExpr::simplify, to
	enable merging of simple range conditions right next to each other

2008-03-21 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: update the use of LOGGER macro to match the
	new definition -- fix error in test cases check-ibis 7 and 8
	* tests/Makefile.am: change check-text to redirect normal output
	from ibis to /dev/null so as to not cluter the output
	* src/index.h: change most of the pure virtual functions in
	ibis::index to have a default implementation so as to minimize the
	required functions to be implemented by a derived class
	* src/part.h:312 add an optional argument to get2DDistribution to
	let the caller choose whether to use the indexes or base data,
	requested by Prabhat
	* src/index.h: change functions read and write to return int
	instead of void
	* src/qExpr.h: rewrite the function reduce to absorb consecutive
	pairs of cos and acos, sin and asin, tan and atan.

2008-03-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp:3899 modify the decision on when to use unix read
	operationis to invoke them if only a few seeks are needed.  This
	should reduce the time needed for operations that only require a
	small number of values from a large dataset.  Previous decision
	relies more in the file mapping mechanism.
	* src/column.cpp: update functions selectTypes to use the new
	selectValues function
	* src/irelic.cpp:556 move the assignment of nrows to the beginning
	of the function to ensure all subsequence function can access the
	the correct value
	* src/ibin.cpp:852,903,2574 add assignment of nrows, without them
	the function ibis::index::optionalUnpack will make the wrong
	decision in some cases (a buf encountered by Prabhat)
	* doc/indexSpec.html: change < and > to &lt; and &gt; in sample
	index specifications
	* src/part.cpp: introduce more rnadomness to the test queries by
	using ibis::util::compactValues in generating intermediate query
	boundaries

2008-03-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* util.h:170 change LOGGER macro to take a logical expression
	instead of an integer, this make the dependency on ibis::gVerbose
	explicit

2008-03-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add explicit template instantiation
	of ibis::part::equalWeightBins for float and double, attempting to
	reduce the time and memory needed to generate equal-weight bins
	* src/array_t.h, src/array_t.cpp: add a new sorting function
	ibis::util::sort to sort two arrays together
	* src/part.cpp: add calls to ibis::util::sort to sort values
	before counting 2D bins (attempting to improve efficiency for
	get2DDistribution)

2008-03-18 Matthias Vallentin <vallentin at icsi.berkeley.edu>
	* src/column.cpp:15 include <typeinfo>

2008-03-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.cpp:4168 limit the number of values to be printed
	* win/tcapi.vcproj: add macro _USRDLL, make sure all Debug versions
	of the projects compile code with full buffer check
	* const.h: redefine FASTBIT_DLLSPEC to FASTBIT_CXX_DLLSPEC, change
	DLL library to only export C API -- did not fix the problem with tcapi

2008-03-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:3618 initialize ierr to 0 (fix a run-time error
	reported by VisualStudio)
	* src/const.h:274 make sure PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER is not
	defined before defining it on Mac (problem reported by Matthias
	Vallentin)
	* src/util.h:14 check for the inclusion of stdlib.h for all known
	unix type of systems (problem reported by Matthias Vallentin)

2008-03-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/Makefile.am: update the definition of test case 7 and 8
	for check-ibis to correct failure of these test cases, remove
	match-counts from large-tests (unnecessary because it is already
	run under the normal check)
	* win/ibis.sln: enable assembly debugging of DLL project in Debug
	mode

2008-03-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.h:302 change the construct of qDiscreteRange that
	takes an array of doubles to sort the incoming values and remove
	duplicates
	* win/ibis.sln: change visual studio solutioni file to build dll
	and trydll by default in both Debug and Release mode
	* win/java.vcproj: failed to compile because of missing
	DLL_EXPORTS macro (problem reported by Mark Sordo)
	* src/query.h:286 remove static private member variable purgeFiles
	* src/util.h: remove static private memeber variable delimiters
	from ibis::selected and ibis::nameList, replace it with
	ibis::util::delimiters
	* src/query.cpp: change ibis::nameList and ibis::selected to use
	ibis::util::delimiters
	* src/part.cpp: adjust the printing statements in various
	histograming functions to make them produce timing information
	when ibis::gVerbose is larger than 0
	* src/part.cpp: add a query involving arithmetic expression in
	ibis::part::quickTest, to check for a problem encountered while
	running the JNI test program
	* tests/scripts/query-count.list: changed four expressions to use
	some arithmatic functions

2008-03-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: replace the calls to bitwise AND operator with the
	new count function in get2DDistributionI
	* src/query.cpp: do not generate the query string from an
	explicitly set query expression, add code to check for null
	condition string in printing statements, change SET_PREDICATE
	condition to base on whether member variable is a valid pointer.
	This is to accommodate the situation where Prabhat and Oliver sets
	a range condition with thousands of values of are requested in one
	query expression.
	* src/bitvector.cpp: lines 856 and 860 swapped, similarly, lines
	660 and 664 in src/bitvector64.cpp are also swapped.  This errors
	causes the variable nbits to be computed incorrectly, which can in
	turn cause other problems later.  This was the cause of a problem
	noticed by Prabhat.
	* src/query.cpp, src/column.h, src/part.h: replace @pre with @code
	and @endcode pairs
	* src/query.cpp:2878 remove the statement, it assumes the wrong
	return value

2008-03-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add a new variation of
	get2DDistribution that computes equal-weight bins for a 2D
	histogram with specified number of bins as requested by Prabhat
	and Oliver
	* examples/ibis.cpp: modify print function to exercise the new
	get2DDistribution function
	* src/bitvector.h, src/bitvector.cpp: add function to count the
	number of bits that are 1 for two bitvectors.  This function can
	be used to by-pass the need to first compute a bitwise logical AND
	operation and reduce the time needed to compute histogram through
	bitmap indexes

2008-03-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/Doxyfile: change EXTRACT_ALL to YES, removed invalid command
	endpre from column.h, part.h, and query.cpp

2008-03-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/imesa.cpp:26 move variable b2 outside of the try-block so it
	can be used in the catch-block to clean up the bitvectors it held
	* src/isbiad.cpp: add try-catch-block to free array beq in both
	sbiad::construct1 and sbiad::construct2, this avoids memory leaks
	in case of exceptions

2008-03-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.cpp, src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, src/ixzona.cpp,
	src/ixfuge.cpp: add logging function calls to print out the
	progress information to help debugging
	* src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, src/ixzona.cpp, src/ixfuge.cpp:
	the two argument version of activateCoarse contain if-test on
	bits[i] == 0, but they should have been cbits[i] == 0.  This
	causes the two-level bitmap indexes to compute wrong answers in
	some cases, especially in large selt tests where bits[i] is more
	likely to have been used before.  In which case, cbits[i] will not
	be activated.  On the other hand, if bits[i] was never used
	(remaining 0), then it is possible for cbits[i] to be activated
	multiple times.  Each time during the activation, it also acquires
	a read lock on the file, however, it is only destroyed once which
	release the lock on the file once.  Therefore, it is possible for
	read locks on the index file to be left intact after the program
	completes.  This causes the clean up function in the file manager
	to fail to acquire a write lock and hung forever.

2008-03-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: change get2DDistributionI and coarsenBins to
	bypass the ibis::query layer to directly use the index object for
	query evaluations, add a try-catch block in get2DDistribution to
	clean up after the array of pointers to bitvectors
	* src/index.cpp: add more functions to print progress messages (to
	help with debugging the deadlock at the clean up stage, bug 8)
	* src/ixbylt.cpp, src/ixfuzz.cpp, src/ixzona.cpp, src/ixfuge.cpp:
	change remaining unsigned types to uint32_t in variables written
	to or read from files

2008-03-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add a function (getJointDistribution) to
	excercise the new get2DDistribition
	* src/part.cpp: add calls to timing functions and logging
	functions in ibis::part::get2DDistributionI and get2DDistributionD

2008-03-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: change dataFileName and
	nullMaskName to return the file names in std::string instead of
	raw char*
	* src/column.h, src/column.cpp: add function indexSize
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: add function get1DDistribution and
	get2DDistribution with support functions to compute the histograms
	with the specified number of bins by using either the indexes or
	the base data depending on which are smaller (Requested by Probhat
	and Oliver)

2008-03-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: change ibis::column::loadIndex to modify the
	in-memory version index specification for the column to prevent it
	from trying to build an index again in the same run.  The
	configuration parameter "disableIndexOnFailure" affects whether
	the new index specification is written down to the metadata file
	-part.txt.
	* Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am: reorganize the top-level targets
	for checking the correctness of FastBit into three levels of
	thoroughness: quick-check, check, and full-check.  Note:
	full-check replaces the earlier target check-all.

2008-03-03 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.cpp:261 throw ibis::bad_alloc exception instead of
	just printing a warning message in case of memory allocation
	failure
	* src/array.h:107 add function incore to tell caller whether the
	content of the array is in memory
	* src/bitvector:159 add check in ibis::bitvector::compress to not
	attempt to compress bitvector not in memory.  Because the file
	associated with the array was opened read-only, modifying it will
	cause segmentation fault.
	* src/tafel.cpp: modify appendRow and readCSV to allow the caller
	to completely override the default delimiters (in response to
	question from Devin McNamara)
	* examples/ardea.cpp: add option -b to accept user to pass in a
	set of breaks (or more commonly known as delimiters) for the text
	file/lines to be parsed
	* src/ibin.h: add destructor to ibis::bak::grain and
	ibis::bak2::grain
	* src/util.h: delete getBuffer, add ibis::util::buffer, replace
	all calls to getBuffer to a buffer object.  This should provide
	better buffer management than using raw pointer.
	* src/mensa.h:271 explicitly cast col to use ibis::text::getString
	(same problem as reported by Ross Bates <rbates@gmail.com>)
	* src/idirekte.cpp: use mask to limit the number of elements
	examined in function ibis::direkte::construct
	* src/tafel.cpp: add check for '/' in ibis::tafel::write to remove
	the possbility of having a data partition name starting with '/'
	* tests/Makefile.am: add target test-text to check for categorical
	values to always check for the problem reported by Ross

2008-03-02 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/colValues.h: combines the cases for ibis::CATEGORY and
	ibis::text, remove the previous code for ibis::CATEGORY that
	returns null string (problem reported by Ross Bates
	<rbates@gmail.com>)
	* src/column.h:109 remove getString that returns char*, no longer
	used
	* src/category.h: add ibis::category::getString
	* tests/Makefile.am: add -z option to ibis commands with -b option
	* src/column.cpp:4375 check that idx is a valid pointer before
	using it  (a problem revealed with make check-all, which involves
	tests cases of relatively large datasets but a very restrictive
	memory upper bound)

2008-02-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: fix count2DBins and count3DBins had logical
	problems

2008-02-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/Doxyfile:1008 enable PREDEFINED macro expansion to make sure
	FASTBIT_DLLSPEC is blank so that doxygen can process the file
	correctly
	* src/bitvector.cpp: update the documentation of bitwise logical
	operations.

2008-02-21 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:4639 remove calls to function flushDir, then
	require a mutex lock on the file manager can cause deadlock
	* src/column.cpp: in evaluateRange, limit the scope of indexLock
	to reduce the chance of deadlock (when memory is running low)
	* src/column.h: add softWriteLock class to try to acquire lock
	when possible -- used in ibis::column::unloadIndex.  While working
	with an index (i.e., holding a read lock), it may be necessary to
	free some memory, which can invoke the unloadIndex function.
	Changing to a soft write lock would allow the invocation to
	complete and avoid deadlock.

2008-02-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ifade.cpp:69&74 correct the offset set calculations, was
	only counting two leading integers.  This causes crashes when
	multi-level range and interval encodings are used without binning
	* src/part.cpp:5869 wrong formula for variable j -- this is
	probably the real cause of the problem observed by Jochen on Feb
	18
	* src/part.cpp: in queryTest and quickTest, call unloadIndex if
	query::evaluate returns an error
	* src/ibin.cpp: modify ibis::bin constructors to consistently fill
	the content of array offsets, ibis::fuge depends on this

2008-02-19 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* Makefile.am, tests/Makefile.am: change target all-tests to
	check-all and have it include both small and large tests
	* src/column.h: remove mutex lock from ibis::column::indexLock
	class, having it causes deadlocks when multiple threads tries to
	access the same index.

2008-02-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: add try-catch blocks in the error-handling code
	of ibis::column::evaluateRange (attempt to address problems
	observed by Jochen on Feb 18)
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test cases in large-sanity-check to limit
	the memory usage during build-in tests

2008-02-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: add try-catch block in selectInts, selectUInts,
	selectLongs, selectFloats, and selectDoubles to address the
	seg fault reported by Jochen on Feb 16.
	* src/query.cpp: update the use of variable newlock to make them
	more consistent across functions

2008-02-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: change <size_t> to <uint32_t> for
	get[1|2|3]DDistribution and supporting functions (requested by
	Prabhat)
	* src/bord.cpp, src/mensa.cpp: update to accomodate the changes to
	get[1|2|3]DDistribution

2008-02-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp: change doScan and doCompare to return long
	* src/part.cpp:2890&2911 change calls to doIntCompare to
	doCompare<int64_t> and doCompare<uint64_t>
	* src/part.h, src/part.cpp: replace comparison functions for
	specific element types with the template functions
	* src/part.cpp:10486&10695: arguments constraints and name were in
	wrong order (problem first reported by Mr. Prabhat)
	* src/column.h: add virtual keyword to selectBytes and friends
	* src/part.cpp: check the return values of selectBytes and friends
	in getDistribution and varients
	* tests/test0.csv, tests/test1.csv: add decimal points to induce
	readcsv.cpp to interpret some columns as double.  This introduces
	one more type of data tested by the automatic test program
	* examples/ibis.cpp:223 swap cname and cond
	* tests/hist0, tests/hist1: add two files for testing
	histogramming functions
	* tests/Makefile.am: add two test cases under check-ibis to test
	histograming functions

2008-02-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:2815 add return value -4 when elementSize() is not
	a positive number
	* src/category.cpp, src/column.cpp, src/ibin.cpp, src/icegale.cpp,
	src/ifade.cpp, src/imesa.cpp, src/irange.cpp, src/ixambit.cpp,
	src/ixpack.cpp, src/ixpale.cpp, src/part.cpp: capture the return
	value of call to UnixSeek in an attempt to prevent a segementation
	fault encounted by Jochen who removes the base data files

2008-02-06 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp: change all decisions regarding when to use
	single-valued bins to use than when there are number of distinct
	values is no more than 3/2 of specified bins.

2008-02-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/qExpr.cpp:1314-1318 comment out the section that converts a
	discrete range into a set of continuous ranges
	* src/index.h:192 add function evaluate for ibis::qDiscreteRange
	* src/part.h, src/column.h, src/part.cpp, src/column.cpp: add
	function to evaluate qDiscreteRange
	* tests/scripts/query-count.list:28&29 modified queries to use
	long lists
	* src/ibin.cpp:3467 col->type() == ibis::DOUBLE should be
	col->type != ibis::DOUBLE; update the block to produce at least
	one bin boundary per inner loop

2008-01-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/idirekte.cpp:482&483 add conditions to prevent casting
	negative floarting-point numbers to unsigned integers
	* tests/scripts/query-count.list: modify some of the 0 query
	boundaries to be negative numbers to exercise the above fix

2008-01-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/ibin.cpp:3929 add fudge factor of 3/2 to allow 50% more bins
	than specified when it can put each value in its own bin.  A user
	was specifying nbins=72 for a variable with 73 distinct values,
	and was confused about why FastBit put two values in the same
	bin.  This should avoid that type of situation.
	* src/index.cpp:534&841 add additional condition to make sure when
	ibis::index::create invokes ibis::direkte, the actual minimum is
	not a negative number.  In a case where the user specified
	minimum=0, but the actual minimum is -1, FastBit crashes when
	building an index

2008-01-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp:4412 remove the line that assigns ierr from low.cnt()

2008-01-16 Jochen Schlosser <schlosser at zbh.uni-hamburg.de>
	* src/part.cpp:2791 add 'delete [] file;' before return statement,
	fix memory leak.  The problem is that the pointer returned by
	dataFileName is not deleted before exiting the function.  The same
	problem appears in a number of different places in src/part.cpp,
	src/parti.cpp and src/party.cpp.

2008-01-15 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: in column::evaluateRange, add better detection
	for the need of invoking doScan, add print statements
	* src/array_c.cpp: add statements to check for nil pointers in all
	constructors
	* src/fileManager.cpp: add statements to prevent printStatus from
	dereferencing nil pointers

2008-01-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/query.cpp: the return values of a few calls to
	ibis::part::doScan did not get passed back to the caller

2008-01-08 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: comment out most of the calls to purgeIndexFiles
	* src/part.cpp: add checks for the existence of raw data file before
	attempting to scan the values
	* src/query.h and src/query.cpp: add functioins to accept new
	forms of query conditions, allow return values to propergate from
	ibis::part and ibis::column functions to ibis::query::evaluate
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add code to check the return values of
	ibis::query::estimate and ibis::query::evaluate

2007-12-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* util.h: add explicit O_BINARY in the macros for file modes,
	without this option, the files are opened in text-mode under MinGW
	following the default on MS Windows systems (there are already
	explicit calls to _setmode under MS Visual Studio environment).
	* util.cpp:104 add execute bit to the mode for the directory
	created by ibis::util::makeDir, a recent change has messed this
	one up

2007-12-20 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* add FASTBIT_DLLSPEC to table.h, remove FASTBIT_DLLSPEC from
	explicit instantiation of array_t
	* update win/Win.mak and win/MinGW.mak to add dependcies for
	trydll.cpp

2007-12-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* add documentation to ibis::qContinuousRange

2007-12-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* change all DLLSPEC to FASTBIT_DLLSPEC
	* add win/MinGW.mak to compile under MinGW/MSYS with GNU g++

2007-12-12 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* add DLLSPEC to classes part, part::info, quey, query::result,
	all members of ibis::bundle hierarchy and many more
	* add win/trydll.cpp to test the new DLL library

2007-12-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/part.cpp:908 update the names used in readMeshShape to match
	those in readTDC
	* src/ibis.h: correct typos in the doxygen documentation

2007-12-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/capi.h:209 partitioin -> partition
	* examples/tcapi.h:56 missed dir (to match %s in fprintf)

2007-12-6 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* change all LOGGER(ibis::gVerbose) to LOGGER(0)
	* const.h:252 & 254 -- add definition of DLLSPEC
	* capi.h:46-54 -- add macro DLLSPEC because it does not include const.h

2007-10-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/index.cpp:539&846: switch > to <

2007-10-25 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/meshQuery.*: change getHitsAsRanges to getHitsAsBlocks

2007-10-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/capi.h and src/capi.cpp: add two functions to accept new
	data records.
	* examples/tcapi.c: add test case for the two new functions in C
	API
	* java: add new functions to allow a java program to input data to
	Fastbit, add a small test section to milky.cpp to be executed when
	no arguments are provided
	* src/tafel.cpp:740 add a line to assign value to tdesc
	* src/capi.cpp:84 add a block to check for the size of the data
	partition found

2007-10-18 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bitvector.h:814&844, add check for nw > 0 *
	src/bitvector64.h:724&754, add check for nw > 0.  These two fix a
	problem caused by a particular word that causes
	ibis::bitvector::copy_runs to pass beyond the end of the array
	m_vec.  This can happen when the word beyond the last element of
	the m_vec is equivalent to a 0-length fill.  Out of 4 billion
	possible values in a 32-bit word just beyond the end of the array
	in a bitvector, 2 of them can do this and they are somehow used by
	the GNU C++ compiler on the intel-based Mac probably for some
	internal marking.

2007-10-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp:901 add statement to prevent FastBit from
	attempting to build indexes for arbitrary strings (ibis::TEXT).
	To build an index for such type of column, FastBit requires
	something called a term-document list (matrix), which most users
	are unlikely to have.  This removes the warning messages when
	running examples/ardea.cpp without any arguments.

2007-10-16 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* java/Makefile.am: add the initial version of automake file
	* tests/scripts/matchCounts.pl: add additional check for error messages

2007-10-14 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* java/milky.java: add a test program that mirrors examples/tcapi.c

2007-10-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* capi.h, capi.cpp: update the C API in preparation for java
	interface

2007-10-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/resoruce.cpp: change all calls to logMessage to use LOGGER
	macro
	* src/predicate.l, src/predicate.y, src/qExpr.h: add operator %

2007-10-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp -- add reverseDeletion and option -k to exercise
	the function ibis::part::reactivate (change doDelete to doDeletion)
	* tests/Makefile.am -- add a small test case for -j and -k options
	of ibis, correct the test cases for check-tcapi
	* src/index.cpp -- in function create, add calls to compute the
	actual min and max when deciding what index to build for default
	options
	* src/array_t.cpp:187 -- add check for isFileMap, otherwise, some
	functions may attempt to modify files open in read-only mode
	* src/array_t.cpp: -- add checks for uninitialized m_begin
	* renamed all dataTable() to partition(), theTable to thePart

2007-10-07 Matthias Vallentin <vallentin at icsi.berkeley.edu>
	* src/parti.cpp:1261 -- change deactivate to reactivate

2007-10-07 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/tafel.cpp: line 912 -- add call to flushDir to remove stale
	references to files.  This may be related to a crash experienced
	by Matthias Vallentin, but I am not able reproduce the crash on
	a MacOS accessible to me.  Add a call to flushDir in
	ibis::part::append1 (in parti.cpp) to address the same problem.
	* tests/Makefile.am: add a second run of ardea to generate 200
	rows of test data for checking the three test programs.  In the
	previous version of the code, running ardea a second time would
	cause errors.

2007-10-05 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add command line option -l for user to
	specify a file to log error messages

2007-10-04 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/util.h, ...: add functions ibis::util::getLogFile and
	ibis::util::setLogFile, add class ibis::util::logger, replace all
	explicit use of std::cout, std::cerr, and std::clog with calls to
	ibis::util::logger

2007-09-24 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* ixfuge.cpp: add this file to implement ibis::fuge class
	for interval-equality encoding with binning

2007-09-17 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* examples/ibis.cpp: add option -j to deactivate rows (reuse -z as
	secondary option to actually expunge the inactive rows)

2007-09-13 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/i*.cpp: change most references to col->dataTable->nRows() to
	nrows stored in the index class.  This change is required to make
	it possible to use index built earlier for a partition with a
	smaller number of rows.

2007-08-30 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* ibis::part: add five new functions to allow existing rows to be
	marked inactive or removed

2007-08-29 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/column.cpp: add code to make use of indexes built form
	smaller number of rows than currently available

2007-08-23 Matthias Vallentin <vallentin at icsi.berkeley.edu>
	* examples/ardea.cpp:53-54 fix wrong flags in usage example

2007-08-23 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/capi.h: add conditional macros to include config.h
	* tests/readcsv.cpp: add conditional macro __APPLE__ for compiling
	on Apple MacOS
	* tests/Makefile.am: change ++ to expr expression for
	compatibility with bourne shell

2007-08-22 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* src/bundle.cpp: in ibis::bundles::sort add special case for
	nPlain() == 0
	* src/mensa.cpp: change ibis::nameList to ibis::selected to
	correct problems with select clauses containing functions
	* examples/thula.cpp: terminate doQuery when the select clause
	contains functions (as indicated by the presence of '(')

2007-08-11 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/Makefile.am: add case number in print out and count the
	number of successful test cases in match-counts

2007-08-10 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* array_t.cpp: change the variables used to store differences
	between two pointers to type size_t or off_t instead of uint32_t
	or int32_t

	* category.cpp: to avoid problems with bad data files, swap
	arguements 2 and 3, truncate large files that have extra records
	(keeping only the first nRows), check number of records in
	function fillIndex when working with a stable copy of the current
	data

	* tests/Makefile.am: add more operations to run for target check

	* doc/quickstart.html: currect typoes and formating mistakes

	* examples/ibis.cpp:2191 add test to prevent the call to indexSpec
	when the user did not specify an indexing option.  Without this
	check, it removes the existing indexing specification when nothing
	is specified.  Change all table to partition in the comments.

2007-08-09 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* tests/Makefile.am: add test case check-ardea to check for the
	problem found by Mark

	* query.cpp: add code to accept count(*) as select clause

	* ibis.cpp: allow multiple threads being used on MS windows; set
	the default number of threads to the number of processors online
	(minus one if more than than two processors are on line)

2007-08-09 Mark Sordo <msordo at yahoo-inc.com>
	* tafel.cpp:746 add tname != 0 to if test

2007-07-27 John Wu <John.Wu at ACM.org>
	* copied files into this new directory structure, start building a
	new set of autoconf/automake scripts.

	* designate the current version a0.7.
