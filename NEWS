-- modify ibis.cpp to accommodate new output produced by arithmetic
   expressions in select clauses
-- add warning messages as suggested by Niklas Bulitta
-- address errors involving short integers (reported by Niklas) and
   other types of integer variables when creating unbinned (precise)

Version b0.9.9
-- add adaptive binning for 3D histograms
-- add histogram functions that output bitvectors instead of counts
-- add print3DDistribution to examples/ibis.cpp and a test case in
   check-ibis
-- add function tableSelect to ibis.cpp to exercise querying through
   ibis::table select function (which accepts arithmetic expressions in

Thu Oct 23 16:42:31 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.8
-- add arithmetic expression to the select clauses accepted by function
   ibis::table::select
-- update java example (correct issues raised by Niklas Bulitta)
-- rewrite the parser for query expressions to use the C++ options of
   bison and flex (predicate* changed to where*)

   expressions under namespace ibis::math
-- address an error report by David Kantowitz about
   ibis::column::getString
-- minor changes to print statement and code organizations

Fri Sep 19 22:38:43 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.7
-- fix an error in mensa.cpp (involving the implementation of
   ibis::mensa::cursor) spotted by David Kantowitz.  Fix two problems 
   involving the same member variable elsewhere in the same file.
-- change _USRDLL to CXX_USE_DLL in the project files to be consistent
   with conditional macros in source code.  The DLL libraries can now be
   compiled and run correctly.
-- update visual studio project files for visual studio 2008
-- increase the cap on the number of bins in adaptive2DBins to make sure

Thu Aug 21 09:58:44 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.6
-- implement new adaptive binning functions for computing histograms of
   1D and 2D that avoids binary searches.  The new functions are not
   only faster, but because they use more fine bins internally the
   output bins are closer to be equal-weight than before
-- change the mensa::cursor class to read data one block at a time so
   that ardea.cpp can print a few row of a large table without running
   out of memory
-- clean up the constructor of qDiscreteRange to eliminate duplicates
   correctly (an error reported by Prabhat)

   provide radix sorting and in-memory natural join (requested by
   Matthias Vallentin)
-- fix bug in ibis::part::writeTDC related to column shape statement
   (reported by Xufei Qian)
-- update testing code to match the change of option -j to -y for
   ibis.cpp (-j is now for join)

Wed May 28 07:38:11 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.3
-- update the range-equality encoding (ibis::bylt and ibis::pack) and
   interval-equality encoding (ibis::fuge and ibis::fuzz) to use the new
   default values for the numbers of coarse bins based on the neutral
   space-time trade-off heuristics
-- add option -f to examples/thula.cpp (requested by Jon Strabala)
-- change ibis::util::userName to primarily use getpwuid (instead of
   getlogin) following the suggestion of Ross Bates

Wed Apr 16 08:28:46 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.2

   of various derived classes, logical error, the file manager should call
   the actual delete
-- remove the use of variable ibis::bitvector::run::nWords when it is
   not a fill
-- correct typos in functions that perform computation on
   qDiscreteRanges, an error first reported by Ross Bates

   instead of long, this eliminates the annoying problem of duplicate
   template instantiation of array_t
-- add ibis::tablex::clearData to remove the current data of a tablex
   object (in response to a request by Matthias)

   observed by Prabhat
-- change decisions regarding the option of using priority queue in
   ibis::index::sumBits to reduces it use, to fix a performance
   irregularity observed by Prabhat
-- fix bug identified while computing histogram with very small number
   of distinct values
-- clean up the printing statements in fileManager.cpp
-- allow multiple print statements to examples/ibis.cpp

Mon Mar 24 11:15:41 PDT 2008
Version b0.8.9
-- update column.cpp to include <typeinfo> (from Matthias of ICSI)
-- attempt to improve the speed of computing histograms by sorting input
   data
-- add assignment of nrows in ibis::bin::construct that takes an array
   as input, a problem found by Prabhat
-- correct html errors in indexSpec.html
-- update decisions in column::selectValues to use the function read
   when it anticipate that a small number of seeks will be needed.  This
   should improve the speed of reading a small number of records.
-- add an optional argument to unconditional version of
   get2DDistribution to allow the caller to choose whether to use
   indexes or data (requested by Prabhat)
-- update test cases 7 and 8 of check-ibis to make them more robust
-- add ibis::util::timer class

Sun Mar 16 23:21:42 PDT 2008

   problem encountered by Prabhat
-- correct tests 7 and 8 of check-ibis in tests/Makefile.am 
-- add test cases involving arithmetic expressions in
   tests/scripts/query-count.list and src/part.cpp (ibis::part::quickTest)
-- fix bugs reported by Mark Sordo (about JNI) and Matthias VAllentin
   (about stdlib.h and PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER macro)

Wed Mar 12 10:20:16 PDT 2008
Version b0.8.7
-- add try-catch blocks to various interval encoded indexes to free
   memory in case of exception
-- add a new variant of get2DDistribution requested by Oliver and Prabhat

   logical AND operations while computing histograms using indexes

Sun Mar  9 07:52:50 PDT 2008
Version b0.8.6
-- add ibis::part::get1DDistribution and ibis::part::get2DDistribution
   that accept user specified number of bins (Requested by Oliver Rubel
   and Prabhat)
-- fix bugs in two-level indexes that cause dead-locks and wrong answers

Tue Mar  4 08:43:42 PST 2008
Version b0.8.5
-- update doxygen documents to work around __declspec directives
-- fix bug reported by Ross Bates <rbates@gmail.com> regarding printing
   categorical values (key), add test cases to check for this error in
   'make check' and 'make quick-check'
-- fix bugs in histograming function ibis::part::count2DBins and
   count3DBins, update the related documentation (bugs reported by Prabhat)
-- in reponse to a question from Devin McNamara, modified readCSV to
   allow arbitrary user-specified delimiters
-- add a set of tests cases that works with very limited memory allowed
   for file manager (invoked through 'make full-check'; inspired by
   Jochen Schlosser).  This has revealed a number of serious problems as
   follows:
-- add ibis::column::softWriteLock to prevent deadlock during tight
   memory situations,
-- add checks for nil pointer of idx before using it,
-- add function in array_t to tell users that it is attached to a file
   or in-memory, this is needed so that ibis::bitvector::compress can
   avoid modifying the ones in files (modifying such bitvector causes
   segmentation faults)
-- add destructors to ibis::bak::grain and ibis::bak2::grain.  If the
   constructor of ibis::bak or ibis::bak2 fails, previous
   implementation of grain do not automatically release the bitvectors
   allocated
-- replace function ibis::util::getBuffer with class ibis::util::buffer
   to ensure the memory allocated is always freed

Wed Feb 20 11:26:11 PST 2008
Version b0.8.4
-- replace ibis::part::doCompare and friends with templated functions
-- add checks for the values returned by lseek and other I/O functions
   to fix a segmentation fault observed by Jochen Schlosser of
   University of Hamburg
-- fix bugs in histogramming functions found by Prabhat: unchecked
   pointers returned by selectInts and friends, uncheck empty arrays,
   swapped string arguments
-- add test cases for checking the histogramming functions in directory
   tests
-- add target check-all to the top-level makefile
-- separate the index generation from their uses in tests (as part of
   check-all) to exercise the index reconstruction functions, fix bug
   revealed by this separation (ibis::fade and ibis::bin)

Wed Feb  6 09:47:21 PST 2008
Version b0.8.3
-- fix a number of bugs reported by Jochen Schlosser of University of
   Hamburg: (1) seg fault due to minimum actually being negative even
   though the metadata indicate it is to be zero or positive, (2) when
   index ibis::direkte is used to answer a query, it erroneously casts
   negative integers numbers to unsigned values and produces incorrect
   answers
-- fix performance a problem reported by Prabhat: a long list in the
   form of "A in (...)" is translated into a massive set of equality
   conditions joined with OR.  Evaluate such a query condition as
   qDiscreteRange.
-- fix bugs in assigning bin boundaries for log-scaled bin on integer
   values and low cardinality columns

Wed Jan 16 12:37:24 PST 2008
Version b0.8.2
-- fix a number of bugs reported by Jochen Schlosser of University of
   Hamburg: ibis::column::evaluateRange calls ibis::part::doScan
   unnecessarily, a number of functions in ibis::fileManager::storage
   class does not check for nil pointers before using them, ibis::part
   has a number of funtions that neglected to free memory returned by
   ibis::column::dataFileName
-- change exception handler to not remove index files unless the index
   files are really at fault
-- add return values to query evaluation function so that a negative
   number will be returned if it fails for any reason, previous version
   neglects to return the error condition to the user

Sun Dec 23 19:33:34 PST 2007
Version b0.8.1
-- add win/MinGW.mak for compiling code under MinGW/MSYS
-- fix ibis::util::makeDir problem with execute bit in directory permission

Tue Dec 11 15:36:04 PST 2007
Version b0.8.0

-- update configuration script to better handle java stuff
 
Wed Oct 24 17:18:51 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.9
-- add functions to C API to allow for input of data records to be
   managed by FastBit
-- add functions to JNI interface for input of data records
-- fix a bug in ibis::tafel::write that leaves tdesc nil

Thu Oct 18 18:53:45 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.8
-- add Jave Native Interface for some querying functions and a test program
-- fix errors found on an intel-base Mac
-- fix errors in the ardea.cpp (when run without any arguments)
-- removed -DDEBUG from configuration option --enable-debug

Tue Oct  9 16:52:55 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.7 includes a couple of bug fixes and some minor clean up
-- incorporates a bug fix from Matthias Vallentin to correct a wrong
   function call in ibis::part::reactivate (src/parti.cpp:1261)
-- add test cases for ibis::part::reactivate in ibis.cpp and
   tests/Makefile.am
-- add checks for array_t::m_begin to ensure it is valid before use
-- renamed all functions named dataTable() to partition() to match the
   name of the classes involved

Sun Oct  7 17:21:16 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.6 introduces a new logging mechanism
-- the new class ibis::util::logger is introduced to allow the error
   message to be redirected to a file.  To specify the name for this
   file, use either the function ibis::util::getLofFile or specify
   logfile in a RC file.

Mon Sep 17 17:09:48 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.5 introduces two new features.
-- allow out-dated indexes to be used during query processing.  Since
   the time needed to full update the indexes are typically longer than
   the time need to answer the queries using the raw data, this option
   improves the query response time for the queries that come right
   after the arrival of new rows.
-- allow for rows to be marked as inactive in a data partition.  These
   inactive rows may eventually be re-activated or permenantly purged
   from a data partition.

Fri Jul 27 21:53:57 PDT 2007
-- First public release, version a0.7.
