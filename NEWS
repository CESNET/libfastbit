Version b0.8.5
-- update doxygen documents to work around __declspec directives
-- fix bug reported by Ross Bates <rbates@gmail.com> regarding printing
   categorical values (key), add test cases to check for this error in
   'make check' and 'make quick-check'
-- fix bugs in histograming function ibis::part::count2DBins and
   count3DBins, update the related documentation (bugs reported by Prabhat)
-- in reponse to a question from Devin McNamara, modified readCSV to
   allow arbitrary user-specified delimiters
-- add a set of tests cases that works with very limited memory allowed
   for file manager (invoked through 'make full-check'; inspired by
   Jochen Schlosser).  This has revealed a number of serious problems as
   follows:
-- add ibis::column::softWriteLock to prevent deadlock during tight
   memory situations,
-- add checks for nil pointer of idx before using it,
-- add function in array_t to tell users that it is attached to a file
   or in-memory, this is needed so that ibis::bitvector::compress can
   avoid modifying the ones in files (modifying such bitvector causes
   segmentation faults)
-- add destructors to ibis::bak::grain and ibis::bak2::grain.  If the
   constructor of ibis::bak or ibis::bak2 fails, previous
   implementation of grain do not automatically release the bitvectors
   allocated
-- replace function ibis::util::getBuffer with class ibis::util::buffer
   to ensure the memory allocated is always freed

Version b0.8.4
-- replace ibis::part::doCompare and friends with templated functions
-- add checks for the values returned by lseek and other I/O functions
   to fix a segmentation fault observed by Jochen Schlosser of
   University of Hamburg
-- fix bugs in histogramming functions found by Prabhat: unchecked
   pointers returned by selectInts and friends, uncheck empty arrays,
   swapped string arguments
-- add test cases for checking the histogramming functions in directory
   tests
-- add target check-all to the top-level makefile
-- separate the index generation from their uses in tests (as part of
   check-all) to exercise the index reconstruction functions, fix bug
   revealed by this separation (ibis::fade and ibis::bin)

Wed Feb  6 09:47:21 PST 2008
Version b0.8.3
-- fix a number of bugs reported by Jochen Schlosser of University of
   Hamburg: (1) seg fault due to minimum actually being negative even
   though the metadata indicate it is to be zero or positive, (2) when
   index ibis::direkte is used to answer a query, it erroneously casts
   negative integers numbers to unsigned values and produces incorrect
   answers
-- fix performance a problem reported by Prabhat: a long list in the
   form of "A in (...)" is translated into a massive set of equality
   conditions joined with OR.  Evaluate such a query condition as
   qDiscreteRange.
-- fix bugs in assigning bin boundaries for log-scaled bin on integer
   values and low cardinality columns

Wed Jan 16 12:37:24 PST 2008
Version b0.8.2
-- fix a number of bugs reported by Jochen Schlosser of University of
   Hamburg: ibis::column::evaluateRange calls ibis::part::doScan
   unnecessarily, a number of functions in ibis::fileManager::storage
   class does not check for nil pointers before using them, ibis::part
   has a number of funtions that neglected to free memory returned by
   ibis::column::dataFileName
-- change exception handler to not remove index files unless the index
   files are really at fault
-- add return values to query evaluation function so that a negative
   number will be returned if it fails for any reason, previous version
   neglects to return the error condition to the user

Sun Dec 23 19:33:34 PST 2007
Version b0.8.1
-- add win/MinGW.mak for compiling code under MinGW/MSYS
-- fix ibis::util::makeDir problem with execute bit in directory permission

Tue Dec 11 15:36:04 PST 2007
Version b0.8.0
-- add DLLSPEC macro to invoke dllexport for building DLL on MS Windows
-- update configuration script to better handle java stuff
 
Wed Oct 24 17:18:51 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.9
-- add functions to C API to allow for input of data records to be
   managed by FastBit
-- add functions to JNI interface for input of data records
-- fix a bug in ibis::tafel::write that leaves tdesc nil

Thu Oct 18 18:53:45 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.8
-- add Jave Native Interface for some querying functions and a test program
-- fix errors found on an intel-base Mac
-- fix errors in the ardea.cpp (when run without any arguments)
-- removed -DDEBUG from configuration option --enable-debug

Tue Oct  9 16:52:55 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.7 includes a couple of bug fixes and some minor clean up
-- incorporates a bug fix from Matthias Vallentin to correct a wrong
   function call in ibis::part::reactivate (src/parti.cpp:1261)
-- add test cases for ibis::part::reactivate in ibis.cpp and
   tests/Makefile.am
-- add checks for array_t::m_begin to ensure it is valid before use
-- renamed all functions named dataTable() to partition() to match the
   name of the classes involved

Sun Oct  7 17:21:16 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.6 introduces a new logging mechanism
-- the new class ibis::util::logger is introduced to allow the error
   message to be redirected to a file.  To specify the name for this
   file, use either the function ibis::util::getLofFile or specify
   logfile in a RC file.

Mon Sep 17 17:09:48 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.5 introduces two new features.
-- allow out-dated indexes to be used during query processing.  Since
   the time needed to full update the indexes are typically longer than
   the time need to answer the queries using the raw data, this option
   improves the query response time for the queries that come right
   after the arrival of new rows.
-- allow for rows to be marked as inactive in a data partition.  These
   inactive rows may eventually be re-activated or permenantly purged
   from a data partition.

Fri Jul 27 21:53:57 PDT 2007
-- First public release, version a0.7.
